# SSHOC - Mapping Raphael to the CIDOC CRM

In 2007 the <a href="https://cima.ng-london.org.uk/documentation">Raphael Research Resource</a> project began to examine how complex conservation, scientific and art historical research could be combined in a flexible digital form. Exploring the presentation of interrelated high resolution images and text, along with how the data could be stored in relation to an event driven ontology in the form of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-concepts/">RDF triples</a>. The original <a href="https://cima.ng-london.org.uk/documentation">main user interface</a> is still live and the data stored within the system has been mapped tot he CIDOC CRM using the code presented here. The SSHOC work aimed to make this data more [FAIR](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) so in addition to mapping it to a standard ontology, to increase Interoprability, it has also been made availbale in the form of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_Data">open linkable data</a> combined with a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SPARQL">SPARQL</a> end-point. This live data presentation can been found [Here](https://rdf.ng-london.org.uk/sshoc/).
