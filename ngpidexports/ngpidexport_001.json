He painted brightly coloured images rooted in German Late Gothic love of ornament, and in its poetic feeling for nature. He also worked as a draughtsman, designer and printmaker, and pursued a career as an architect and town councillor.<br><br>\r\nAltdorfer was born in about 1480 in Bavaria and was probably trained by his father Ulrich. He acquired rights of citizenship in Regensburg in 1505. During his lifetime various upheavals took place in the city, such as the conversion to Protestantism, and the expulsion of the Jews in 1519.<br><br>\r\nHis works suggest a knowledge of Italian painting, although whether he visited Italy itself remains an open question.

He received his earliest training with his uncle, the celebrated view painter Canaletto, from about 1735 onwards, and was accepted into the Fraglia dei Pittori (Venetian painters\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 guild) at the age of just 16. In the 1740s Bellotto travelled extensively around the Italian peninsula, producing views of various cities including Florence, Rome, Verona and Turin. He was called to Dresden in 1747, and the subsequent year was appointed Court Painter to Augustus III, King of Poland and Elector of Saxony. Following the escalation of the Seven Years\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 War around 1758, Bellotto worked at the courts of Vienna (ca. 1758\/59\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u00931761) and Munich (1761), before returning again to Dresden (1761\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009366). He spent the last 13\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0years of his life in Warsaw, at the court of Augustus III\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s successor as King of Poland, King Stanislaus II August Poniatowski.<\/p>\n<p>Bellotto tends towards a more silvery light than Canaletto, as well as a cooler palette and a greater sense of monumentality. Even when one of his compositions derived from a painting by his uncle, Bellotto tended to increase it in both size and scale. One of the most distinctive elements of his pictures is his use of impasto, particularly in the sky, where broad brushstrokes denote clouds and changing light on the horizon.<\/p>\n<p>Today, Bellotto is best known for his views of northern European cities, which are considered his greatest achievements. These works are characterised by panoramic compositions, strongly contrasted use of light and shadow, and meticulous attention to architectural detail. Such was Bellotto\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s precision that his late views of Warsaw played a crucial role in that city\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s reconstruction after the Second World War. He sometimes signed himself Bellotto de Canaletto, and is therefore known in some places as Canaletto.<\/p>","objects":{"000-01CI-0000":"NG2514","000-03D2-0000":"NG6668","000-03LK-0000":"NG135"},"artists":{"001-00C3-0000":"Bernardo Bellotto"},"date_range":{"begin":"1736-01-01","end":"1800-12-31"},"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-000D-0000":"Landscapes","00A-000E-0000":"Rivers","00A-000G-0000":"Water","00A-000S-0000":"Buildings","00A-000T-0000":"Transportation","00A-000W-0000":"Transport","00A-000X-0000":"Vessels","00A-000Y-0000":"Boats","00A-001S-0000":"Temples","00A-0028-0000":"Churches","00A-0036-0000":"Housing","00A-003D-0000":"Sculpture","00A-003F-0000":"Weather","00A-004H-0000":"History","00A-004M-0000":"Houses","00A-004O-0000":"Statues","00A-004P-0000":"Cities","00A-006F-0000":"Travellers"},"artist_type":"subartist","artist_class":"other","ArtistDisplayDate":"1722 - 1780","pdate":[["born","standard",["1722-01-01","1722-12-31","1722",{"within":["1720s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["18th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]],["died","standard",["1780-01-01","1780-12-31","1780",{"within":["1780s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["18th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]]]},"001-00C4-0000":{"type":"artist","pid":"001-00C4-0000","name":"George Bellows","title":"","description":"Born in Columbus, Ohio, in 1882, Bellows studied at the Ohio State University.

His precocious talent was manifested in a series of sculptures made for Cardinal Scipione Borghese. In Rome he designed and supervised projects that integrated architecture, painting and sculpture, such as the Cornaro chapel in S. Maria della Vittoria, which contains the statue of 'The Ecstasy of Saint Theresa'. <br><br>\r\nHe was also the originator of the figurative Baroque fountains of Rome, such as the Four Rivers on the Piazza Navona. Bernini's colonnade in front of St Peter's transformed the approach to the church into a magnificent reception area for pilgrims to the city. <br><br>\r\nBernini was not primarily a painter; his few pictures are mainly head studies and portraits. The 'Saints Andrew and Thomas' in this Collection shows some of the animation later realised in his sculpture. The work of Caravaggio influenced his painting style, and he was also an admirer of Rubens and Poussin.<\/p>","objects":{"000-031C-0000":"NG6381"},"artists":{"001-00D6-0000":"Gian Lorenzo Bernini"},"date_range":{"begin":"1622-01-01","end":"1626-12-31"},"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0002-0000":"Christianity","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0004-0000":"Men","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-001C-0000":"Beards","00A-001D-0000":"Saints","00A-003C-0000":"Fish"},"artist_type":"normal","artist_class":"named","ArtistDisplayDate":"1598 - 1680","pdate":[["born","standard",["1598-01-01","1598-12-31","1598",{"within":["1590s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["16th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]],["died","standard",["1680-01-01","1680-12-31","1680",{"within":["1680s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["17th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]]]},"001-00DD-0000":{"type":"artist","pid":"001-00DD-0000","name":"Giovanni Battista Bertucci the Elder","title":"","description":"<p>Also known as Giovanni Battista da Faenza.

His graceful pictures of the Madonna and Child, his altarpieces and his life-size mythological paintings, such as 'Venus and Mars', were immensely popular in his lifetime.<\/p>\n<p>The son of a tanner, he was born Alessandro di Mariano Filipepi, but he was given the nickname 'Botticelli' (derived from the word 'botticello' meaning 'small wine cask'). Smart beyond his years, the young Botticelli became easily bored at school. He was known for his sharp wit and his love of practical jokes, and he quickly earned a reputation as a restless, hyperactive and impatient child. Fortunately, his precocious talent was recognised and he was withdrawn from school and sent to work as an apprentice.<br \/><br \/>It is thought that Botticelli first trained with Maso Finiguerra, a goldsmith, before entering the studio of the artist Fra Filippo Lippi. He began his career painting frescoes for Florentine churches and cathedrals, and worked with the painter and engraver Antonio del Pollaiuolo. By 1470, he had his own workshop.<\/p>\nTo Rome and Back\n<p>In 1472, Botticelli joined the Compagnia di San Luca, the confraternity of Florentine painters. He also employed Filippino Lippi, his late teacher's son, as his apprentice, and broke convention by completing Filippino's version of 'The Adoration of the Kings' - it was far more usual for an apprentice to finish a painting by his master rather than the other way round. <br \/><br \/>Botticelli's apprenticeship with Fra Filippo gave him excellent contacts. His master had enjoyed the patronage of some of the leading families in Florence, such as the Medici. Botticelli in turn spent almost all his life working for the Medici family and their circle of friends, for whom he painted some of his most ambitious secular paintings such as 'Primavera' (in the Uffizi, Florence). <br \/><br \/>Botticelli's star was in the ascendant. Such was his reputation that, in 1481, he was summoned by the Pope to Rome to help decorate the walls of the recently completed Sistine Chapel in the Vatican. He painted frescoes depicting scenes from the Life of Moses and the Temptations of Christ and was also responsible for a number of papal portraits. The nature of this task demonstrates how highly regarded he was around this time, and it was the only occasion he is known to have worked outside Florence.<\/p>\nMythologies\n<p>A year later, Botticelli returned to Florence, to continue with the most prolific stage of his career. <br \/><br \/>The period from 1478-90 saw Botticelli at his most creative. This was the period during which he produced his famous mythological works, such as 'The Birth of Venus' (in the Uffizi, Florence) and 'Venus and Mars'. In these he successfully combined a decorative use of line (possibly owing much to his early training as a goldsmith) with elements of the classical tradition, seen in the harmony of his composition and the supple contours of his figures.<\/p>\nReligion and Politics\n<p>During the last 15 years of his life, Botticelli's work appeared to undergo a crisis of style and expression. <br \/><br \/>The 1490s was a turbulent decade - the Medici had been expelled from Florence and Italy's peace disrupted by invasion and plagues. Botticelli rejected the ornamental charm of his earlier works in favour of a more simplistic approach that seemed crude and heavy-handed by contrast. These later paintings, with their deep moral and religious overtones, also suffered a comparison with the sophisticated aesthetic of artists such as Michelangelo and Raphael.<br \/><br \/>According to Vasari in his book 'The Lives of the Artists', in his latter years Botticelli became a follower of the fanatical Dominican friar Savonarola, and the pious sentiment of his later works would seem to suggest some involvement in the religious and political upheavals in Florence at the time. 'Mystic Nativity' is Botticelli's most ambitious painting from this period and reflects this sense of apocalyptic foreboding.<\/p>\nFinal Years\n<p>Vasari also suggests that, as his work fell out of favour, Botticelli became melancholic and depressed. He had never married, preferring the company of family and friends.

Characterised by their dramatic, almost theatrical lighting, Caravaggio's paintings were controversial, popular, and hugely influential on succeeding generations of painters all over Europe.<br \/><br \/>Born Michelangelo Merisi, Caravaggio is the name of the artist's home town in Lombardy in northern Italy. In 1592 at the age of 21 he moved to Rome, Italy's artistic centre and an irresistible magnet for young artists keen to study its classical buildings and famous works of art. The first few years were a struggle. He specialised in still lifes of fruits and flowers, and later, half length figures (as in 'The Boy bitten by a Lizard') which he sold on the street.<br \/><br \/>In 1595, his luck changed. An eminent Cardinal, Francesco del Monte, recognised the young painter's talent and took Caravaggio into his household. Through the cardinal's circle of acquaintance, Caravaggio received his first public commissions which were so compelling and so innovative that he became a celebrity almost overnight.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"442\" height=\"249\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/1KcdgFxmnb4?list=PLvb2y26xK6Y5RvnFbi2aZ_KKhaTz7kMBx&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><\/iframe><\/p>\nRome\n<p>Caravaggio was a fast worker - but liked to play as hard as he worked. According to one of his biographers: ''after a fortnight's work he will swagger about for a month or two with his sword at his side and with a servant following him, from one ball-court to the next, ever ready to engage in a fight or argument, with the result that it is most awkward to get along with him''. (The sword was illegal - as with guns today, one had to have licence to carry arms.) Caravaggio was arrested repeatedly for, among other things, slashing the cloak of an adversary, throwing a plate of artichokes at a waiter, scarring a guard, and abusing the police.<br \/><br \/>Caravaggio's technique was as spontaneous as his temper. He painted straight onto the canvas with minimal preparation. Sometimes he abandoned a disappointing composition and painted new work over the top. Much to the horror of his critics, he used ordinary working people with irregular, rough and characterful faces as models for his saints and showed them in recognisably contemporary surroundings. In many paintings, such as the 'Supper at Emmaus', he makes his paintings appear to be an extension of real space, deliberately making the viewers feel as if they are taking part in the scene.<\/p>\n<p>In 1606 Caravaggio's temper went a step too far. An argument with 'a very polite young man' described variously as over a woman, or a tennis match, escalated into a swordfight. Caravaggio stabbed his rival, and though he probably hadn't intended to kill him, the man died of his wound. Caravaggio chose not to face justice, but leave Rome. He had no doubt that he would quickly obtain a pardon.<\/p>\nMalta\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0\n<p>Caravaggio went to Naples, and then to the island of Malta, an independent sovereignty and home of the Knights of Malta (a religious military order like the Knights Templars). If Caravaggio could become a Knight of Malta, he would be in a better position to seek a papal pardon for the murder. In return for a painting of the Beheading of St John the Baptist, he was granted membership.<\/p>\n<p>His social standing in Malta was high - his reward included two slaves and a gold chain. All was going to plan, until his temper got him into trouble again. He got into a fight with another knight and found himself in prison. He escaped, but was expelled from the order.<\/p>\nPardon and death\n<p>Caravaggio travelled around Sicily and then returned to Naples where he was involved in yet another bar brawl which left him badly disfigured. In the meantime, however, important friends in Rome had successfully petitioned the Pope for a pardon - Caravaggio could return. <br \/><br \/>He loaded his belongings onto a ship but, for some unknown reason, was then arrested and had to buy his way out of jail. By the time he was released, the ship and all his possessions had sailed without him.

After an education at the Coll\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a8ge de Rouen and two abortive apprenticeships with drapers, he was given the financial freedom at the age of 26 to devote himself to painting.<\/p>\n<p>He first studied with the landscapist Achille Etna Michallon, and after his death with Jean-Victor Bertin (around 1767 to 1842), both pupils of Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes. In 1825 to 1828 Corot made the trip to Italy considered so essential to the formation of a landscape artist, spending time in Rome and the Campagna, before travelling to Naples. In 1827 he sent his first paintings to the Paris Salon: View at Narni (Ottawa, National Gallery of Canada) and Roman Campagna (Zurich, Kunsthaus).<\/p>\n<p>Corot returned to Italy in 1834 and 1843. He also travelled extensively in France, to Normandy, Provence, the Morvan region in Burgundy, to which he returned for many years, and to north-east France in 1871 during the Commune. In 1854 he travelled in Holland and Belgium; he regularly visited Switzerland, and in 1862 he was in London.<\/p>\n<p>During these trips Corot painted in the open air and filled numerous notebooks with drawings. His early oil sketches, such as those painted in Italy, were clearly defined and fresh, using bright colours in fluid strokes. During the winter months he worked in the studio on ambitious mythological and religious landscapes destined for the salon. Hagar in the Wilderness (New York, Metropolitan Museum of Art), exhibited at the salon of 1835, is characteristic of his early work, and, like his open-air studies, features the clear-cut forms and colours of academic painting.<\/p>\n<p>His reputation was established by the 1850s, which was also the period when his style became softer and his colours more restricted. In his late studio landscapes, which were often peopled with bathers, bacchantes and allegorical figures, he employed a small range of colours, often using soft coloured greys and blue-greens, with spots of colour confined to the clothing of the figures.<\/p>\n<p>Topographical detail was suppressed in favour of mood and atmosphere, above all in his \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098souvenirs\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099, which were based on memories of real landscapes. The popularity of these combined with Corot\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s encouragement of younger artists to copy his pictures (which he then signed), either as a learning exercise or for producing works for sale, resulted in numerous forgeries and imitations, as well as difficulties of attribution.<\/p>\n<p>At the Exposition Universelle of 1855 Corot showed six paintings and won a gold medal. His influence on later 19th-century landscape painting, including the Impressionists, was immense, particularly in his portrayal of light on the landscape. For a long time, however, especially among collectors, the popularity of his late work overshadowed appreciation of his early studies.<\/p>","objects":{"000-01D2-0000":"NG3285","000-02QP-0000":"NG4181","000-02SA-0000":"NG4733","000-02VL-0000":"NG6467","000-02VM-0000":"NG6466","000-02WZ-0000":"NG6531","000-02Y4-0000":"NG6339","000-02YC-0000":"NG6340","000-0302-0000":"NG6439","000-0308-0000":"NG6416","000-0340-0000":"NG6651","000-034B-0000":"NG6654","000-034D-0000":"NG6652","000-034Q-0000":"NG6653","000-04HH-0000":"NG2625","000-04M5-0000":"NG2626","000-04N4-0000":"NG2135","000-04OC-0000":"NG3239","000-04OD-0000":"NG3238","000-04OE-0000":"NG3237","000-04R0-0000":"NG3816","000-04SV-0000":"NG2631","000-04SW-0000":"NG2630","000-04SX-0000":"NG2629","000-04SY-0000":"NG2628","000-04V2-0000":"NG2627","000-0BHG-0000":"NG6620"},"artists":{"001-00WA-0000":"Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot"},"date_range":{"begin":"1826-01-01","end":"1912-12-31"},"keywords":{"00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0008-0000":"Robes","00A-000B-0000":"Animals","00A-000D-0000":"Landscapes","00A-000E-0000":"Rivers","00A-000F-0000":"Plants","00A-000G-0000":"Water","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000K-0000":"French","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-000S-0000":"Buildings","00A-000T-0000":"Transportation","00A-000V-0000":"Seascapes","00A-000W-0000":"Transport","00A-000X-0000":"Vessels","00A-000Y-0000":"Boats","00A-001J-0000":"Portraits","00A-001O-0000":"Weddings","00A-001P-0000":"Marriage","00A-001Q-0000":"Lakes","00A-001W-0000":"Birds","00A-002G-0000":"Vegetation","00A-002J-0000":"Sports","00A-002M-0000":"Roads","00A-0035-0000":"Home","00A-0036-0000":"Housing","00A-003E-0000":"Cathedrals","00A-003F-0000":"Weather","00A-004A-0000":"Dresses","00A-004L-0000":"Italy","00A-004M-0000":"Houses","00A-0076-0000":"Wood","00A-007U-0000":"Natural resources","00A-007Z-0000":"France","00A-008R-0000":"Wetlands"},"artist_type":"normal","artist_class":"named","ArtistDisplayDate":"1796 - 1875","pdate":[["born","standard",["1796-01-01","1796-12-31","1796",{"within":["1790s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["18th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]],["died","standard",["1875-01-01","1875-12-31","1875",{"within":["1870s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["19th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]]]},"001-00WD-0000":{"type":"artist","pid":"001-00WD-0000","name":"Correggio","title":"","description":"<p>Antonio Allegri, called Correggio (from his native town near Parma), was the leading Emilian painter of the early 16th century and one of the greatest Italian artists of the Renaissance.

The Gallery's 'The Annunciation', 'Jesus opens the Eyes of a Man born Blind' and 'The Transfiguration' are fragments from it.<br><br>\r\nDuccio's date of birth is not known but he was active in Siena by 1278, and spent most of his working life there. He is unusual among medieval artists for being well documented. Duccio's art is based on Byzantine sources, but was deeply influenced by the sculpture of the Pisani and by French Gothic metalwork. His work is both decorative in the use of line, colour and pattern, and highly expressive. He is less interested in volume, than his younger contemporary Giotto.<br><br>\r\n'The Maest\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a0' was one of the largest and most complex altarpieces ever produced. Its influence can be seen in the predella panels for an altarpiece by the Sienese painter Ugolino, which imitates the treatment of subjects in the 'Maest\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a0'.<\/p>","objects":{"000-03IN-0000":"NG566","000-03WS-0000":"NG1330","000-044R-0000":"NG1140","000-044S-0000":"NG1139"},"artists":{"001-0145-0000":"Duccio"},"date_range":{"begin":"1307-01-01","end":"1317-12-31"},"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0002-0000":"Christianity","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0004-0000":"Men","00A-0005-0000":"Women","00A-0006-0000":"Worship","00A-0007-0000":"Kneeling","00A-0008-0000":"Robes","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000P-0000":"Families","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-001C-0000":"Beards","00A-001D-0000":"Saints","00A-003B-0000":"Worshipers","00A-006J-0000":"Scrolls"},"artist_type":"normal","artist_class":"named","ArtistDisplayDate":"active 1278; died 1319","pdate":[["active","standard",["1278-01-01","1278-12-31","1278",{"within":["1270s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["13th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]],["died","standard",["1319-01-01","1319-12-31","1319",{"within":["1310s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["14th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]],["born","automatic",["1240-01-01","1259-12-31","Before 1260s",{"within":[],"overlaps":[],"contains":["1240s","1250s"]},{"within":["13th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"dec","before"]]]},"001-0148-0000":{"type":"artist","pid":"001-0148-0000","name":"Joseph Ducreux","title":"","description":"<p>He was born in Nancy, and became a pupil of Maurice Quentin de la Tour and was influenced by Greuze.

In 1621 he was in the service of James I of England, but left to visit Italy, where he remained until 1627. His aristocratic rendering of Genoese patricians, like the so-called 'Balbi Children', were very well received in that city. After a second period in the Netherlands, greater success awaited Van Dyck when he settled at the English court in 1632. His authoritative and flattering representations of Charles I and his family set a new standard for English portraiture to which members of the court were keen to aspire.<\/p>","objects":{"000-0194-0000":"NG49","000-02OJ-0000":"NG5633","000-02SR-0000":"NG4889","000-02U3-0000":"NG6502","000-02UA-0000":"NG6494","000-02UE-0000":"NG6518","000-0304-0000":"NG6437","000-030I-0000":"NG6364","000-030S-0000":"NG6363","000-032R-0000":"NG6567","000-034H-0000":"NG6575","000-03ML-0000":"NG156","000-03MU-0000":"NG52","000-03MW-0000":"NG50","000-03OQ-0000":"NG853","000-03QX-0000":"NG877.2","000-03RA-0000":"NG877","000-0431-0000":"NG1172","000-04N2-0000":"NG2144","000-04N7-0000":"NG2127","000-04QD-0000":"NG3605","000-04QW-0000":"NG3537","000-04S0-0000":"NG3011","000-04U8-0000":"NG3132"},"artists":{"001-0157-0000":"Anthony van Dyck"},"date_range":{"begin":"1617-01-01","end":"1827-12-31"},"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0002-0000":"Christianity","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0004-0000":"Men","00A-0005-0000":"Women","00A-0006-0000":"Worship","00A-0008-0000":"Robes","00A-0009-0000":"Sisters","00A-000B-0000":"Animals","00A-000C-0000":"Weapons","00A-000F-0000":"Plants","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000I-0000":"Mythology","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000M-0000":"Playing","00A-000N-0000":"Musical instruments","00A-000O-0000":"Music","00A-000P-0000":"Families","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-000T-0000":"Transportation","00A-000W-0000":"Transport","00A-0012-0000":"Aristocracy","00A-0013-0000":"Kings","00A-001A-0000":"Love","00A-001C-0000":"Beards","00A-001D-0000":"Saints","00A-001J-0000":"Portraits","00A-001K-0000":"Cloth","00A-001L-0000":"Italian","00A-001P-0000":"Marriage","00A-001V-0000":"Youth","00A-001W-0000":"Birds","00A-0023-0000":"Children","00A-0024-0000":"Infants","00A-002D-0000":"Boys","00A-002Q-0000":"Flemish","00A-002R-0000":"Faith","00A-002S-0000":"Swords","00A-003A-0000":"Fruit","00A-003D-0000":"Sculpture","00A-003E-0000":"Cathedrals","00A-003Q-0000":"Horses","00A-003S-0000":"Sons","00A-003T-0000":"Jewellery","00A-0042-0000":"Satyrs","00A-0045-0000":"Cupids","00A-004A-0000":"Dresses","00A-004H-0000":"History","00A-004R-0000":"Necklaces","00A-004S-0000":"Dress","00A-004W-0000":"Leisure","00A-004Z-0000":"Food","00A-005K-0000":"Footwear","00A-005M-0000":"Shoes","00A-0060-0000":"Earrings","00A-006A-0000":"Flutes","00A-006D-0000":"Fashion","00A-006F-0000":"Travellers","00A-007A-0000":"Tunics","00A-0089-0000":"English","00A-008P-0000":"Princes"},"artist_type":"normal","artist_class":"named","ArtistDisplayDate":"1599 - 1641","pdate":[["born","standard",["1599-01-01","1599-12-31","1599",{"within":["1590s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["16th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]],["died","standard",["1641-01-01","1641-12-31","1641",{"within":["1640s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["17th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]]]},"001-0158-0000":{"type":"artist","pid":"001-0158-0000","name":"Josephus Laurentius Dyckmans","title":"","description":"<p>He was born in Lierre, and studied in Antwerp, where he exhibited and where he died.

Over the next decade he was employed in various ways, including as a lay preacher.

On his return to Paris in 1886 he met artists such as Degas, Gauguin and Seurat, and as a result lightened the colours he used.<br \/><br \/>In 1888 Van Gogh settled in Arles in Provence, where he was visited by Gauguin and painted his now famous series of 'Sunflowers'. In the following year a nervous breakdown brought him to a sanatorium at St Remy; it was at this period that he executed 'A Wheatfield, with Cypresses'.

Much later, the dazzling virtuosity of his brushwork became an important precedent for the achievements of the 19th-century French artist, Edouard Manet.<\/p>","objects":{"000-02UU-0000":"NG6458","000-02ZO-0000":"NG6413","000-02ZQ-0000":"NG6411","000-03X9-0000":"NG1251","000-042K-0000":"NG1021","000-04GR-0000":"NG2528","000-04GV-0000":"NG2529","000-04M0-0000":"NG2285"},"artists":{"001-01NO-0000":"Frans Hals"},"date_range":{"begin":"1626-01-01","end":"1652-12-31"},"keywords":{"00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0005-0000":"Women","00A-0009-0000":"Sisters","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000M-0000":"Playing","00A-000P-0000":"Families","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-001J-0000":"Portraits","00A-001V-0000":"Youth","00A-0023-0000":"Children","00A-002D-0000":"Boys","00A-002T-0000":"Death","00A-003S-0000":"Sons","00A-003T-0000":"Jewellery","00A-0049-0000":"Girls","00A-004H-0000":"History","00A-004Q-0000":"Bracelets","00A-004X-0000":"Gold","00A-0056-0000":"Daughters","00A-005Y-0000":"Mortality","00A-0065-0000":"Brothers","00A-0068-0000":"Metal"},"artist_type":"normal","artist_class":"named","ArtistDisplayDate":"1582\/3 - 1666","pdate":[["born","standard",["1582-01-01","1583-12-31","1582-1583",{"within":["1580s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["16th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year-range",""]],["died","standard",["1666-01-01","1666-12-31","1666",{"within":["1660s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["17th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]]]},"001-01OE-0000":{"type":"artist","pid":"001-01OE-0000","name":"Henri-Joseph Harpignies","title":"","description":"<p>Harpignies was born in Valenciennes.

He moved to Amsterdam shortly after his father's death in December 1640 and received further training in the studio of Rembrandt, at the time when Carel Fabritius was also there. His early works show the influence of Rembrandt.<br><br>\r\nIn 1648 Hoogstraten returned to Dordrecht, but shortly afterwards travelled to Vienna and Rome (1651-3), and later to London (1662-6).After living for some years in The Hague, Hoogstraten returned to Dordrecht in 1673 and spent his last years there writing an important treatise on painting, 'Introduction to the High School of the Art of Painting', which was published in 1678, the year of his death. It includes reminiscences of his stay in Rembrandt's studio and is a valuable source of information about Rembrandt's views on painting. It also criticizes Rembrandt for his excessive naturalism.<\/p>","objects":{"000-01CL-0000":"NG3832"},"artists":{"001-01T4-0000":"Samuel van Hoogstraten"},"date_range":{"begin":"1653-01-01","end":"1662-12-31"},"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0002-0000":"Christianity","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-0023-0000":"Children","00A-002B-0000":"Furniture","00A-004J-0000":"Objects","00A-004X-0000":"Gold","00A-004Y-0000":"Coins","00A-007N-0000":"Silver"},"artist_type":"normal","artist_class":"named","ArtistDisplayDate":"1627 - 1678","pdate":[["born","standard",["1627-01-01","1627-12-31","1627",{"within":["1620s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["17th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]],["died","standard",["1678-01-01","1678-12-31","1678",{"within":["1670s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["17th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]]]},"001-01TC-0000":{"type":"artist","pid":"001-01TC-0000","name":"John Hoppner","title":"","description":"<p>Hoppner was born of German parentage in London, where he worked.

Though many of his works were never finished, and even fewer have survived, he influenced generations of artists and he continues to be revered as a universal genius.<br \/><br \/>Leonardo was born near the Tuscan hill-town of Vinci. An illegitimate child, he was raised by his paternal grandfather. His father had a flourishing legal practice in the city of Florence, where Leonardo received his early artistic training with the sculptor Andrea Verrocchio.<br \/><br \/>Verrocchio's workshop undertook a wide range of commissions including sculpture and decorative metalwork as well as paintings.<\/p>\nFrustrated in Florence\n<p>By 1472, Leonardo had joined the brotherhood of Florentine artists, the Compagnia di San Luca, and he worked in Florence for the next ten years, but few paintings survive. <br \/><br \/>He made numerous drawings, however, which revealed his growing interest in other disciplines, including geometry, anatomy and engineering. <br \/><br \/>By 1483, Leonardo felt stifled and decided that Milan would offer more exciting opportunities. He wrote to the ruling family, the Sforzas, asking for employment primarily on the grounds that he was an expert in military engineering. He mentioned his skill in painting and sculpture as an added bonus. Soon after his move to Milan, a confraternity commissioned an altarpiece, and Leonardo created 'The Virgin of the Rocks'. When they refused to give what he considered a fair price for the painting, he sold it to someone else in disgust and it was some years before the confraternity could persuade him to do a second version - the one that now hangs in the National Gallery.<\/p>\nThe notebooks\n<p>Leonardo kept notebooks of his research into science, biology, anatomy, engineering and art. (He was particularly keen on flying machines, and came up with a design for a type of helicopter, although it was never built.) <br \/><br \/>The books were filled with drawings and diagrams, and covered with notes written in mirror handwriting and he kept them for the rest of his life. <br \/><br \/>Leonardo's major artistic achievement at this time was his depiction of 'The Last Supper', which he painted for the wall of the refectory of Santa Maria della Grazie. 'The Last Supper' perfectly illustrates Leonardo's belief that poses, gestures and facial expressions should reflect the 'motions of the mind'.<\/p>\nMilan, Rome and France\n<p>In 1499 the French army invaded Milan and Leonardo returned to Florence. He was fascinated by the mystery of the face and by the possibility of reading the 'motions of the soul' through facial expressions and gesture. Leonardo's portrait of the wife of a Florentine official, known as the 'Mona Lisa' is famous for its sitter's enigmatic expression.<br \/><br \/>Leonardo soon tired of Florence however, and by the summer of 1508 he was back in Milan, working for the French rulers of the city. He began work on a series of compositions of the Virgin and Child. Before beginning a painting, he would work out his composition in a drawing - the famous Burlington House Cartoon is a preparatory work for a painting now in the Louvre, Paris. <br \/><br \/>This second period in Milan lasted until 1513 and was followed by three years in Rome. At some point during this period he was brought to the attention of the French king and was offered employment as 'first painter and engineer' at the royal court. Leonardo accepted the offer and in 1517 he moved to the Chateau of Cloux, near Amboise, where he spent the rest of his life.<\/p>\nFinal years\n<p>Towards the end of his life, Leonardo was plagued by ill-health and a stroke left him paralysed down the right side of his body. Despite this, his notebooks reveal that he was surprisingly active, though it is likely that his assistants carried out most of the physical work. However, his mood deteriorated and he is thought to have been dogged by a persistent and overwhelming sense of pessimism. <br \/><br \/>He became increasingly obsessed with his experiments and scientific projects. These interfered with his artistic commissions and he became even more notorious for not finishing anything. He completed so few works in his lifetime that a whole industry sprang up around the search for 'real Leonardos' with many pastiches and copies being paraded as originals. <br \/><br \/>In April 1519 Leonardo, now 67, drew up his will. He left most of his works to his adored pupil and companion, Francesco Melzi. He died later that year and was buried in Amboise.<\/p>","objects":{"000-02YF-0000":"NG6337","000-03W9-0000":"NG1300","000-0419-0000":"NG1093","000-041Z-0000":"NG1661"},"artists":{"001-027C-0000":"Leonardo da Vinci"},"date_range":{"begin":"1488-01-01","end":"1515-12-31"},"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0002-0000":"Christianity","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0005-0000":"Women","00A-0006-0000":"Worship","00A-0008-0000":"Robes","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000M-0000":"Playing","00A-000N-0000":"Musical instruments","00A-000O-0000":"Music","00A-000P-0000":"Families","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-0015-0000":"Angels","00A-001D-0000":"Saints","00A-0023-0000":"Children","00A-0024-0000":"Infants","00A-002D-0000":"Boys","00A-0049-0000":"Girls","00A-004T-0000":"Drawings","00A-005P-0000":"Inscriptions"},"artist_type":"normal","artist_class":"named","ArtistDisplayDate":"1452 - 1519","pdate":[["born","standard",["1452-01-01","1452-12-31","1452",{"within":["1450s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["15th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]],["died","standard",["1519-01-01","1519-12-31","1519",{"within":["1510s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["16th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]]]},"001-027J-0000":{"type":"artist","pid":"001-027J-0000","name":"Stanislas-Victor-Edmond L\u00e9pine","title":"","description":"<p>L\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9pine is said to have been a pupil of Corot.

Filippino's father died in 1469 and he was soon in the workshop of Botticelli, who worked with Filippino on one Adoration of the Kings. A Milanese agent in Florence reported in about 1490, 'Filippino: a pupil of Botticelli and son of the most outstanding master of his time'.<br \/><br \/>Filippino's fame spread throughout Italy and he painted major series of frescoes in Rome as well as Florence. He was also a renowned painter of altarpieces, receiving commissions from Milan, Bologna and Genoa.<br \/><br \/>Perhaps through the historical misfortune of being eclipsed by the next generation, in particular by Raphael and Michelangelo, Filippino's contemporary success, greater than even that of his teacher Botticelli, is now forgotten. His sacra conversazione influenced High Renaissance artists and he can be seen as a link between the achievements of the 15th and 16th centuries.<\/p>","objects":{"000-01A3-0000":"NG592","000-01AP-0000":"NG1412","000-01B6-0000":"NG1124","000-02SL-0000":"NG4905","000-02SV-0000":"NG4904","000-03I7-0000":"NG293","000-03R0-0000":"NG927"},"artists":{"001-00GX-0000":"Sandro Botticelli","001-0293-0000":"Filippino Lippi"},"date_range":{"begin":"1468-01-01","end":"1502-12-31"},"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0002-0000":"Christianity","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0004-0000":"Men","00A-0005-0000":"Women","00A-0006-0000":"Worship","00A-0007-0000":"Kneeling","00A-0008-0000":"Robes","00A-000B-0000":"Animals","00A-000D-0000":"Landscapes","00A-000F-0000":"Plants","00A-000G-0000":"Water","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000N-0000":"Musical instruments","00A-000O-0000":"Music","00A-000P-0000":"Families","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-0013-0000":"Kings","00A-001C-0000":"Beards","00A-001D-0000":"Saints","00A-001H-0000":"Reading","00A-001U-0000":"Motherhood","00A-0023-0000":"Children","00A-002D-0000":"Boys","00A-002U-0000":"Dance","00A-003B-0000":"Worshipers","00A-003Q-0000":"Horses"},"artist_type":"normal","artist_class":"named","ArtistDisplayDate":"about 1457 - 1504","pdate":[["born","standard",["1455-01-01","1459-12-31","About 1457",{"within":["1450s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["15th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year","about"]],["died","standard",["1504-01-01","1504-12-31","1504",{"within":["1500s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["16th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]]]},"001-0294-0000":{"type":"artist","pid":"001-0294-0000","name":"Fra Filippo Lippi","title":"","description":"<p>'Fra Filippo Lippi was gracious and ornate and exceedingly skilful; he was very good at compositions and at variety, at colouring, relief, and in ornaments of every kind', wrote Cristoforo Landino in 1480; his comment remains a valid assessment of Fra Filippo's style.

In 1464 they dressed up as Romans for a boating excursion on Lake Garda. In the 'Triumphs of Caesar' Mantegna indulged his interest in antique art, which can also be seen in the Gallery's 'Cult of Cybele'. He developed a painting technique which enabled him to imitate the look of classical sculpture. Mantegna produced engravings which helped spread his designs and fame beyond Italy. From possibly humble origins Mantegna rose to become a valued retainer of the Gonzaga.

The Virgin and Child\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0in the National Gallery is the central fragment of one of his most important works, a polyptych made at the age of 25 for the church of the Carmine in Pisa.<br \/><br \/>Masaccio is recognised as one of the founders of the Florentine school of art. His monumental figures are sculpted by light; this approach was first employed by the Florentine Giotto a century earlier. Masaccio combined it with a careful use of linear perspective to give an impression of believable forms in space.<br \/><br \/>Masaccio was influenced by the advances in sculpture of his friend Donatello, which he then applied to painting. His greatest surviving works are the frescoes of the Brancacci Chapel from Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence.

The distinctive rolling hills are depicted in a number of his works, such as 'The Nativity'.

By 1439 he was working in Florence with Domenico Veneziano, whose treatment of space, like that of Uccello, must have influenced him. <br \/><br \/>Piero was also a mathematical theorist. This interest is reflected in the clearly defined volume of the figures and accurate perspective in his works. It is balanced by a naturalism which derived from Netherlandish art. His patrons were among the most powerful men in Italy: the Duke of Urbino, Sigismund Malatesta in Rimini, and Pope Nicholas V in Rome. According to tradition, Piero taught Signorelli.

In Rome he evolved as a portraitist, and became one of the greatest of all history painters.<br \/><br \/>He remained in Rome for the rest of his life and in 1514, on the death of Bramante, he was appointed architect in charge of St Peter's.<\/p>","objects":{"000-019Q-0000":"NG27","000-02R4-0000":"NG3943","000-02VC-0000":"NG6480","000-02VY-0000":"NG6596","000-03GL-0000":"NG213","000-03N5-0000":"NG168","000-03R9-0000":"NG929","000-03V7-0000":"NG744","000-0432-0000":"NG1171","000-04FY-0000":"NG2510","000-04JK-0000":"NG2069","000-04S6-0000":"NG2919"},"artists":{"001-03DN-0000":"Raphael"},"date_range":{"begin":"1500-01-01","end":"1899-12-31"},"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0002-0000":"Christianity","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0004-0000":"Men","00A-0005-0000":"Women","00A-0006-0000":"Worship","00A-0007-0000":"Kneeling","00A-0008-0000":"Robes","00A-000B-0000":"Animals","00A-000C-0000":"Weapons","00A-000F-0000":"Plants","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000P-0000":"Families","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-000S-0000":"Buildings","00A-0015-0000":"Angels","00A-001A-0000":"Love","00A-001D-0000":"Saints","00A-001F-0000":"Books","00A-001H-0000":"Reading","00A-001J-0000":"Portraits","00A-0023-0000":"Children","00A-0024-0000":"Infants","00A-0028-0000":"Churches","00A-002B-0000":"Furniture","00A-002D-0000":"Boys","00A-002I-0000":"Sleep","00A-002L-0000":"Processions","00A-002S-0000":"Swords","00A-003D-0000":"Sculpture","00A-003Q-0000":"Horses","00A-004S-0000":"Dress","00A-005J-0000":"Artists"},"artist_type":"normal","artist_class":"named","ArtistDisplayDate":"1483 - 1520","pdate":[["born","standard",["1483-01-01","1483-12-31","1483",{"within":["1480s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["15th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]],["died","standard",["1520-01-01","1520-12-31","1520",{"within":["1520s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["16th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]]]},"001-03EA-0000":{"type":"artist","pid":"001-03EA-0000","name":"Odilon Redon","title":"","description":"<p>Redon was, with Gustave Moreau, one of the leading artists of the French Symbolist movement.

His father was a miller, comfortably off and able to send Rembrandt to the town's Latin School. At the age of 14, Rembrandt began studying at the famous University of Leiden (unusual for a miller's son), but academic life did not suit him. After a few months he left to begin an apprenticeship as a painter.<\/p>\n<p>Leiden did not offer much in the way of artistic talent, and in 1624, after three years with a local painter, Rembrandt went to Amsterdam to study briefly with Pieter Lastman. He then moved back to Leiden and set up as an independent painter, sharing a workshop with Jan Lievens. It was not an easy climate in which to work. Following the Protestant Reformation, the local churches no longer provided artists with any commissions as the Catholic church did in other countries. As a consequence artists had to concentrate on commissions from private individuals. Rembrandt quickly began to make a name for himself as a painter of historical subjects.<\/p>\n<p>Unusually, Rembrandt did not follow the advice that was given to young painters, namely to travel to Italy to study Italian art first hand. Instead he felt that he could learn everything he needed to from the art available in his native country.<\/p>\n<p><iframe width=\"442\" height=\"249\" src=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/embed\/ENYeIydLtWI?list=PLvb2y26xK6Y5RvnFbi2aZ_KKhaTz7kMBx&amp;showinfo=0\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"><\/iframe><\/p>\nAmsterdam and marriage\n<p>In around 1631, Rembrandt moved to Amsterdam, the most prosperous port in northern Europe, and 'crowded with merchants from every nation'. It offered a young and successful artist far more opportunities than sleepy Leiden. <br \/><br \/>Rembrandt lodged in the house of an art dealer called Hendrick van Uylenburgh, and while there, he met his landlord's young cousin Saskia. They were married in 1634. The numerous paintings and drawings of her suggest the two were very happily married. In 1636, Saskia gave birth to their first son, Rumbartus. He died after only two weeks. Over the next four years two more children were born, but died within a couple of months. <br \/><br \/>Professionally, Rembrandt went from strength to strength. The most important families and organisations in the city commissioned paintings. As well as portraits, he produced baroque history paintings such as Belshazzar's Feast. Cash flow was sometimes a problem\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a0\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0093 and Rembrandt's cash flowed rather freely. He was a compulsive buyer of art, and a collector of all manner of antiquities, props, and weapons to be used in paintings. Saskia's family accused him of squandering her fortune. But Rembrandt was the most famous artist in the city. What could go wrong?<\/p>\nContinued success\n<p>In 1639, Rembrandt and Saskia moved into a grander house, next to his old friend van Uylenburgh. He sketched endlessly - people on the street, beggars, circuses, women and children, Saskia. His painting was influenced by new developments in Italian art which reached the Netherlands via prints, and via his more travelled colleagues. Many of his contemporaries had started to experiment with the dramatic use of lighting developed by Caravaggio.<br \/><br \/>The influence of Caravaggio is evident in Rembrandt's work from the 1630s. He developed a new way of describing faces with patterns of light and shadow, rather than simply lighting one side and shading the other. Shadows around the eyes of his portraits, making it hard to read a precise expression give his canvases the extraordinary impression of the living, thinking mind behind the face. <br \/><br \/>In 1641 a fourth child, Titus, was born. And lived. Saskia was unwell after the birth and Rembrandt made various drawings of her looking tired and drawn in bed. In 1642, Saskia made a will leaving Rembrandt and Titus her fortune, although most of Rembrandt's share would be lost if he married. She died shortly after, still aged only 30, probably from plague or TB.<\/p>\nDomestic complications\n<p>Alone with a baby to care for, Rembrandt had to employ a nurse and took on a widow called Geertge Dircx. She became his common law wife for a short time, but then he took on another servant, Hendrickje Stoffels, and fell in love with her. Geertge took Rembrandt to court on the grounds that he had promised to marry her. He charged her with pawning some of Saskia's jewellery that she had left to Titus in her will. After much bitter wrangling, Rembrandt somehow had her sent to a house of correction. Meanwhile he and Hendrickje lived happily together, except that the terms of Saskia's will meant that he couldn't afford to marry her. She appears in numerous paintings, and may have been the model for A Woman Bathing.<\/p>\n<p>One notable aspect of his later paintings is the use of broad brushstrokes, sometimes applied with a palette knife. While the earlier pictures had a smooth finish, the later works are designed to work only from a distance.<\/p>\nBankruptcy\n<p>In the 1650s Amsterdam was hit by a massive economic depression. Rembrandt had not even completed half the payments on his house and his creditors began to chase him for money. <br \/><br \/>In July 1656, he successfully applied for 'cessio bonorum' - a respectable form of bankruptcy which avoided imprisonment. All his goods, including an impressive collection of paintings, were sold off for a pittance. Rembrandt, Titus and Hendkrickje moved across town to a much poorer district, where Rembrandt continued to paint. He had always used himself as a model, but in the last twenty years of his life he painted self portraits with increasing frequency. In 1663, Hendrickje died after a long illness. Titus was left to look after his father. Continued money problems forced them to sell Saskia's tomb, but still Rembrandt could not resist putting in an offer for a Holbein that came up for sale. <br \/><br \/>Titus married in 1668 the daughter of an old family friend, then seven months later, he died. A daughter, Titia, was born six months later. In 1669, Rembrandt himself died and was buried in the Westerkerk next to Hendrickje and Titus. There was no official notice of his death.<\/p>","objects":{"000-0170-0000":"NG6350","000-0187-0000":"NG6274","000-0191-0000":"NG45","000-0192-0000":"NG47","000-0198-0000":"NG221","000-019F-0000":"NG54","000-01AH-0000":"NG672","000-02NL-0000":"NG5282","000-02QM-0000":"NG4189","000-02SI-0000":"NG4930","000-02Z8-0000":"NG6300","000-0309-0000":"NG6432","000-03ET-0000":"NG243","000-03FZ-0000":"NG190","000-03M3-0000":"NG166","000-03N0-0000":"NG43","000-03N6-0000":"NG51","000-03OS-0000":"NG850","000-03W2-0000":"NG775","000-03XB-0000":"NG1247","000-040F-0000":"NG1400","000-04FV-0000":"NG2538","000-04FW-0000":"NG2539","000-04KH-0000":"NG1675","000-04KI-0000":"NG1674","000-04OO-0000":"NG3214"},"artists":{"001-03EP-0000":"Rembrandt"},"date_range":{"begin":"1600-01-01","end":"1725-12-31"},"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0002-0000":"Christianity","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0004-0000":"Men","00A-0006-0000":"Worship","00A-0007-0000":"Kneeling","00A-0008-0000":"Robes","00A-000B-0000":"Animals","00A-000C-0000":"Weapons","00A-000E-0000":"Rivers","00A-000F-0000":"Plants","00A-000G-0000":"Water","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000P-0000":"Families","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-000S-0000":"Buildings","00A-000T-0000":"Transportation","00A-000W-0000":"Transport","00A-0010-0000":"Soldiers","00A-0013-0000":"Kings","00A-0018-0000":"Grief","00A-0019-0000":"Guilt","00A-001D-0000":"Saints","00A-001F-0000":"Books","00A-001H-0000":"Reading","00A-001I-0000":"Knowledge","00A-001J-0000":"Portraits","00A-001K-0000":"Cloth","00A-001S-0000":"Temples","00A-001U-0000":"Motherhood","00A-001V-0000":"Youth","00A-0023-0000":"Children","00A-0027-0000":"Writing","00A-0029-0000":"Mourning","00A-002B-0000":"Furniture","00A-002R-0000":"Faith","00A-002S-0000":"Swords","00A-002T-0000":"Death","00A-002Z-0000":"Thieves","00A-0030-0000":"Dutch","00A-0037-0000":"Judaism","00A-0038-0000":"Altars","00A-0039-0000":"Punishment","00A-003B-0000":"Worshipers","00A-003D-0000":"Sculpture","00A-003G-0000":"Bathing","00A-003L-0000":"Language","00A-003T-0000":"Jewellery","00A-003Y-0000":"Thinking","00A-004H-0000":"History","00A-004R-0000":"Necklaces","00A-004S-0000":"Dress","00A-004X-0000":"Gold","00A-004Z-0000":"Food","00A-0053-0000":"Priests","00A-005J-0000":"Artists","00A-005N-0000":"Wisdom","00A-005P-0000":"Inscriptions","00A-0060-0000":"Earrings","00A-006D-0000":"Fashion","00A-007N-0000":"Silver"},"artist_type":"normal","artist_class":"named","ArtistDisplayDate":"1606 - 1669","pdate":[["born","standard",["1606-01-01","1606-12-31","1606",{"within":["1600s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["17th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]],["died","standard",["1669-01-01","1669-12-31","1669",{"within":["1660s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["17th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]]]},"001-03ER-0000":{"type":"artist","pid":"001-03ER-0000","name":"Guido Reni","title":"","description":"<p>Reni was trained by Denys Calvaert, and then probably in the Carracci workshop.

Not only was he an enormously successful painter whose workshop produced a staggering number of works; but he also played an important diplomatic role in 17th-century European politics. He was clearly a charming and attractive companion, described as having 'a tall stature, a stately bearing, with a regularly shaped face, rosy cheeks, chestnut brown hair, sparkling eyes but with passion restrained, a laughing air, gentle and courteous'.<br \/><br \/>Peter Paul Rubens was born in Siegen in Germany, but from the age of 10 he lived and went to school in Antwerp. His first job, at the age of 13, was as court page to a countess. It was a prestigious position for a young man, but Rubens found it stifling and began training as an artist. <br \/><br \/>As soon as he had completed his training, he set out for Italy in order to see for himself the great Renaissance and classical works that he knew from copies. For eight years, he travelled and worked in Spain, copying and incorporating the techniques of Renaissance and classical art.<\/p>\nAntwerp\n<p>In 1608 news came that Rubens's mother was dying. He left immediately for Antwerp, but by the time he arrived she had died. Once home, Rubens decided to stay in the city. His reputation had preceded him, and in 1609 at the age of 33 he was appointed court painter to the rulers of the Netherlands, the Archduke Albert and his wife Isabella.The following year, he married his own Isabella - Isabella Brandt.<br \/><br \/>Rubens could now afford to buy a grand house in a fashionable part of Antwerp. He built a large studio to accommodate his pupils and assistants (he received far too many commissions to complete them all single-handedly). He designed it himself in an Italian style. He also added a circular sculpture hall, based on the Pantheon, to the house.<br \/><br \/>Rubens's major business was altarpieces, particularly suitable for an artist who enjoyed working on a grand scale. A diligent and disciplined man, he rose at 4am each day and worked until 5 in the evening before going out riding to keep himself physically fit. While painting, he would have someone read to him from a work of classical literature. An enthusiastic collector of gems, ancient sculpture and coins, and other curiosities (including an Egyptian mummy), Rubens's collection became a well-known attraction for visiting dignitaries.<\/p>\nThe diplomat\n<p>In 1622 Rubens was commissioned to carry out a huge project in Paris for the notoriously difficult Maria de Medici, widow of King Henry IV of France. Two entire galleries were to be decorated with scenes from the lives of the queen and her late husband. The commission was a fraught one. Maria was awkward and changeable; and her favourite, Cardinal Richelieu, saw Rubens as a political threat. After years of wrangling, the project was abandoned half completed when Maria was banished from court.<\/p>\n<p>In 1625 the plague reached Antwerp. Rubens moved his family to Brussels until the worst of it had passed. They then moved back to Antwerp where, to Rubens's horror, his wife became ill and died, probably of plague. Usually a man who prided himself on his stoicism, Rubens was devastated by the loss of 'one whom I must love and cherish as long as I live'.<\/p>\n<p>Rubens threw himself into his diplomatic work in order to distract himself. He spent several months in England where he carried out several commissions for Charles I who was a passionate collector of art. One of the commissions that Rubens was to carry out for Charles was the decoration of the roof of his new Banqueting House at Whitehall.<\/p>\nCourt artist\n<p>From the mid-1620s Rubens become increasingly busy with diplomatic duties. Antwerp, in the southern Netherlands, was part of an empire ruled by Catholic Spain. The Protestant northern Netherlands were united under Dutch rule. Both sides hoped to unite the Netherlands under their own regime.<\/p>\n<p>In 1610, a\u00c3\u0082\u00c2\u00a012 year truce between the Dutch and the Spanish had allowed the Archdukes Albert and Isabella to continue their Catholic rule in peace and stability. In 1621 the truce came to an end and just at this crucial time, the sovereign Archduke Albert died. His consort, Isabella, continued as governor but her situation was a precarious one as Spain, France and England tried to decide who they should ally themselves with, and against whom. <br \/><br \/>Rubens was called upon to negotiate in France and England on behalf of Isabella as the representative of the Spanish Netherlands. Because painters often had reason to travel to foreign courts, he was well placed to carry out secret or delicate visits without his presence arousing suspicion. He became a close confidante of Isabella and she valued his advice.<br \/><br \/>In 1624 Rubens was granted a patent of nobility by Isabella's nephew Philip IV and in 1627 she moved him even further up the social scale by making him a 'gentleman of the household'.<\/p>\nLast years\n<p>After 18 months abroad, Rubens had had enough of the thankless task of politicking. He returned to Antwerp to see his children and to look after his domestic affairs. He could also dedicate himself entirely to painting. One of his most important patrons in the 1630s was King Philip IV of Spain who commissioned over 80 paintings. <br \/><br \/>In 1630, at the age of 53, Rubens married again. To everyone's surprise he did not marry into the nobility, but chose H\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9l\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a8ne Fourment, the 16 year-old daughter of a respectable merchant family. Rubens was clearly bowled over by his new wife with whom he had five children, and she figures in numerous portraits, including a version of 'The Judgement of Paris' in which she appears as Venus. <br \/><br \/>During his last years Rubens spent increasing amounts of time with his new young family in his country house, the Chateau de Steen. He began to paint more landscapes, often for his own enjoyment, rather than for sale. <br \/><br \/>Having suffered painfully from gout for several years, in 1639 a particularly bad attack left Rubens unable to paint and he died a few months later in May 1640.<\/p>","objects":{"000-016O-0000":"NG4815","000-019B-0000":"NG194","000-019N-0000":"NG66","000-01A8-0000":"NG157","000-01AV-0000":"NG948","000-01B7-0000":"NG853.1","000-01BQ-0000":"NG852","000-01D5-0000":"NG2924","000-02VI-0000":"NG6461","000-0312-0000":"NG6393","000-031E-0000":"NG6379","000-032Z-0000":"NG57.2","000-03GC-0000":"NG187","000-03IH-0000":"NG279","000-03II-0000":"NG278","000-03LF-0000":"NG38","000-03MO-0000":"NG59","000-03MQ-0000":"NG57.1","000-03MY-0000":"NG46","000-03NO-0000":"NG67","000-03TB-0000":"NG680","000-043Y-0000":"NG1195","000-04H6-0000":"NG2598","000-04QX-0000":"NG3819","000-04QY-0000":"NG3818","000-04S2-0000":"NG2968","000-06PO-0000":"NG57.3"},"artists":{"001-03IW-0000":"Peter Paul Rubens"},"date_range":{"begin":"1595-01-01","end":"1643-12-31"},"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0002-0000":"Christianity","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0004-0000":"Men","00A-0005-0000":"Women","00A-0008-0000":"Robes","00A-000B-0000":"Animals","00A-000C-0000":"Weapons","00A-000D-0000":"Landscapes","00A-000E-0000":"Rivers","00A-000F-0000":"Plants","00A-000G-0000":"Water","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000I-0000":"Mythology","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000N-0000":"Musical instruments","00A-000O-0000":"Music","00A-000P-0000":"Families","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-000S-0000":"Buildings","00A-000T-0000":"Transportation","00A-000W-0000":"Transport","00A-000X-0000":"Vessels","00A-000Y-0000":"Boats","00A-0012-0000":"Aristocracy","00A-0014-0000":"Greed","00A-0015-0000":"Angels","00A-0016-0000":"Envy","00A-0017-0000":"Anger","00A-0018-0000":"Grief","00A-001D-0000":"Saints","00A-001F-0000":"Books","00A-001J-0000":"Portraits","00A-001Q-0000":"Lakes","00A-001S-0000":"Temples","00A-001U-0000":"Motherhood","00A-001V-0000":"Youth","00A-001W-0000":"Birds","00A-0023-0000":"Children","00A-0024-0000":"Infants","00A-0025-0000":"Happiness","00A-0026-0000":"Physicians","00A-0028-0000":"Churches","00A-002E-0000":"Rituals","00A-002F-0000":"Ceremonies","00A-002G-0000":"Vegetation","00A-002J-0000":"Sports","00A-002N-0000":"Climate","00A-002O-0000":"Sheep","00A-002P-0000":"Chaos","00A-002Q-0000":"Flemish","00A-0035-0000":"Home","00A-0036-0000":"Housing","00A-0037-0000":"Judaism","00A-0039-0000":"Punishment","00A-003A-0000":"Fruit","00A-003B-0000":"Worshipers","00A-003C-0000":"Fish","00A-003D-0000":"Sculpture","00A-003F-0000":"Weather","00A-003I-0000":"Monasteries","00A-003J-0000":"Relatives","00A-003P-0000":"Hunters","00A-003Q-0000":"Horses","00A-003T-0000":"Jewellery","00A-0041-0000":"Beauty","00A-0042-0000":"Satyrs","00A-0045-0000":"Cupids","00A-0046-0000":"Bulls","00A-0047-0000":"Health","00A-004F-0000":"Conflict","00A-004H-0000":"History","00A-004X-0000":"Gold","00A-0054-0000":"Gods","00A-0055-0000":"Goddesses","00A-0057-0000":"Apple","00A-0058-0000":"Medusa","00A-005X-0000":"Symbolism","00A-0060-0000":"Earrings","00A-006A-0000":"Flutes","00A-006C-0000":"Greek","00A-006R-0000":"Lions","00A-007D-0000":"Carpets","00A-007V-0000":"Daily life"},"artist_type":"normal","artist_class":"named","ArtistDisplayDate":"1577 - 1640","pdate":[["born","standard",["1577-01-01","1577-12-31","1577",{"within":["1570s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["16th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]],["died","standard",["1640-01-01","1640-12-31","1640",{"within":["1640s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["17th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]]]},"001-03J5-0000":{"type":"artist","pid":"001-03J5-0000","name":"Jacob van Ruisdael","title":"","description":"<p>Jacob van Ruisdael was one of the most famous landscape painters of 17th-century Holland, and the foremost exponent of the classical phase of Dutch landscape painting.

His work was imitated by many followers, including his son, David Teniers III.<br \/><br \/>Teniers was born in Antwerp and probably trained by his father, David Teniers the Elder. The work of Brouwer was an important influence. Teniers produced a more refined version of Brouwer's peasant scenes, and later created scenes of fashionable life. His work was also influenced by his father-in-law Jan Brueghel.<br \/><br \/>In 1632-3 Teniers became a master in the guild of Saint Luke in Antwerp. By 1649 he was probably already working for the King of Spain, as well as for Prince William of Orange and the Governor of the Netherlands, the Archduke Leopold William.<br \/><br \/>In 1651 Teniers moved to Brussels where Archduke Leopold became his main employer.

After Gentile\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s death in 1507, Titian joined the workshop of Gentile's brother, Giovanni Bellini, which at that time was the most important in Venice.<\/p>\n<p>However, it was through contact with Giorgione, who had also previously trained in Giovanni Bellini\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s workshop, that he mainly developed his early style. The Giorgionesque appearance of Titian\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s early work, which is characterised by a pastoral mood, is proof of their closeness. In 1508-9 they worked together on the decoration of the external walls of the \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098Fondaco dei Tedeschi\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 in Venice. The parts executed by Titian were greatly praised by contemporaries, much to the annoyance of Giorgione.<\/p>\n<p>After Giorgione\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s death in 1510, and Sebastiano del Piombo\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s departure to Rome in 1511, Titian launched his independent career in Venice. He was now left without rivals among his generation who could compete at his level.<\/p>\nEarly local success\n<p>In 1511 Titian painted his celebrated frescoes in the \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098Scuola del Santo\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 in Padua. His style had now reached maturity, marked by fullness of forms, compositional confidence and chromatic balance. These features made his work fundamental to the development of Venetian \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0093 and also European \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0093 painting.<\/p>\n<p>He became famous as a portraitist (examples in the National Gallery are La Schiavona and Portrait of Gerolamo (?) Barbarigo). He was also known as a painter of various profane subjects. These skills drew the attention of intellectually ambitious Italian dukes and aristocrats.<\/p>\n<p>Titian was also commissioned to paint prestigious public religious paintings. His Venetian success was sealed by the execution of the altarpiece for the high altar of the important Franciscan church of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari in Venice. The so-called \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098Assunta\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 (Assumption of the Virgin Mary), which is nearly seven metres high, was displayed in 1518, creating a revolutionary watershed in Venetian altarpiece design.<\/p>\n<p>Between 1519 and 1526, he painted the celebrated \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098Pala Pesaro\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 for the same church. This asymmetrical composition strongly influenced Venetian altarpiece painting right up until the 18th century.<\/p>\nNorth Italian courts\n<p>Early in 1516 Titian started his professional relationship with Alfonso I d\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099Este, Duke of Ferrara and spent time in Alfonso\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s castle. The duke wanted to create a private cabinet, which would be known as the \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098camerino d\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099alabastro\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 (the alabaster cabinet), with mythological scenes derived from classical poetry.<\/p>\n<p>The duke employed the painters he considered to be the best at the time. Apart from Titian, the other artists were Raphael, Fra Bartolomeo and Dosso Dossi. Following the deaths of Raphael and Fra Bartolomeo Titian\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s involvement in the project increased. He then executed his two famous Bacchanals for Alfonso I, today in the Prado, Madrid, along with Bacchus and Ariadne, now in the National Gallery.<\/p>\n<p>Titian also worked for the court of Mantua. In 1523 he began painting for the future Duke of Mantua, Federico II Gonzaga the son of Isabella d\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099Este (who was the sister of Titian\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s earlier patron Alfonso I). Titian mainly painted portraits for the Mantuan court.<\/p>\n<p>In 1532 Titian started to work for the Duke of Urbino, Francesco Maria della Rovere. He would also work for his successor, Guidobaldo II. In the 1530s, he was also in touch with the court of Pope Paolo III Farnese.<\/p>\nWorldwide success, family and friends\n<p>The 1520s were hugely significant for Titian\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s private life. In 1525 he married Cecilia (who tragically died in 1530). Titian and Cecilia had three children, who were all given the names of famous figures from ancient Rome: Pompeo, Orazio and Lavinia.<\/p>\n<p>Titian\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s meeting with the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V in Bologna in 1530 would be a determining event in his life. On this occasion Titian executed a (now lost) full-length, life-size portrait of the Emperor - an early example of what was still an extremely innovative genre at that time.<\/p>\n<p>He rapidly became the principal painter to the imperial court, which gave him immense privileges, honours and even titles. From this moment he was the painter most in demand at courts across Europe. Titian also became the official painter of Charles V\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s son, Philip II of Spain. Starting in about 1551, he painted the celebrated mythological series of pictures for Philip, which he referred to as \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098poesie\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099. <br \/><br \/>The 'poesie' included Diana and Actaeon and Diana and Callisto, which are now part of the National Gallery's collection, along with The Death of Actaeon, which was originally conceived as part of the series, but in fact remained unfinished in the artist's studio at his death.<\/p>\n<p>In 1527 the Florentine sculptor and architect Jacopo Sansovino and the Tuscan man of letters Pietro Aretino arrived in Venice. They became inseparable friends with Titian, stimulating his interest in Mannerism, a style first seen in his paintings from that period. Mannerist aspects in his art increased after his only trip to Rome in 1545-6, where he finally got the opportunity to meet Michelangelo.<\/p>\nLate years\n<p>The last phase of Titian\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s life coincided with a radical revision of his own style and painting technique. Starting from the late 1550s, Titian developed a much freer use of the brush and a less descriptive representation of reality.<\/p>\n<p>In the late 1560s and early 1570s, when Titian was already extremely old, he pushed his art to the edge of abstraction. This later style has been defined as \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098magic impressionism\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099. All of this is well represented by two of his latest works, The Death of Actaeon at the National Gallery, and the \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098Piet\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a0\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099, now in the Gallerie dell\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099Accademia in Venice.<\/p>\n<p>The \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098Piet\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a0\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099 was originally destined for his own tomb in the church of Santa Maria Gloriosa dei Frari, where Titian was buried after dying of the plague on 27 August 1576.<\/p>","objects":{"000-017Z-0000":"NG3948","000-019S-0000":"NG270","000-01CW-0000":"NG1944","000-02NU-0000":"NG5385","000-02R7-0000":"NG3949","000-02T5-0000":"NG4452","000-02T9-0000":"NG4222","000-02ZT-0000":"NG6420","000-0316-0000":"NG6376","000-03FR-0000":"NG224","000-03HK-0000":"NG635","000-03JE-0000":"NG4","000-03JF-0000":"NG3","000-03JT-0000":"NG35","000-03JU-0000":"NG34","000-03R5-0000":"NG933","000-0456-0000":"NG1123","000-05UW-0000":"NG6611","000-05UX-0000":"NG6616"},"artists":{"001-0419-0000":"Titian"},"date_range":{"begin":"1508-01-01","end":"1699-12-31"},"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0002-0000":"Christianity","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0004-0000":"Men","00A-0005-0000":"Women","00A-0006-0000":"Worship","00A-0007-0000":"Kneeling","00A-0008-0000":"Robes","00A-000B-0000":"Animals","00A-000E-0000":"Rivers","00A-000F-0000":"Plants","00A-000G-0000":"Water","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000I-0000":"Mythology","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000M-0000":"Playing","00A-000N-0000":"Musical instruments","00A-000O-0000":"Music","00A-000P-0000":"Families","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-000R-0000":"Shepherds","00A-0015-0000":"Angels","00A-0017-0000":"Anger","00A-001A-0000":"Love","00A-001C-0000":"Beards","00A-001D-0000":"Saints","00A-001J-0000":"Portraits","00A-001L-0000":"Italian","00A-001V-0000":"Youth","00A-001W-0000":"Birds","00A-0023-0000":"Children","00A-002C-0000":"Pets","00A-002D-0000":"Boys","00A-002J-0000":"Sports","00A-002K-0000":"Dogs","00A-002L-0000":"Processions","00A-002T-0000":"Death","00A-0038-0000":"Altars","00A-003D-0000":"Sculpture","00A-003G-0000":"Bathing","00A-003T-0000":"Jewellery","00A-004E-0000":"Old age","00A-004G-0000":"Coats","00A-004H-0000":"History","00A-006Y-0000":"Poets","00A-008S-0000":"Candles","00A-008T-0000":"Titian"},"artist_type":"subartist","artist_class":"imitator","ArtistDisplayDate":"active about 1506; died 1576","pdate":[["active","standard",["1504-01-01","1508-12-31","About 1506",{"within":["1500s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["16th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year","about"]],["died","standard",["1576-01-01","1576-12-31","1576",{"within":["1570s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["16th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]],["born","automatic",["1504-01-01","1508-12-31","About 1506",{"within":["1500s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["16th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year","about"]]]},"001-041C-0000":{"type":"artist","pid":"001-041C-0000","name":"Louis Tocqu\u00e9","title":"","description":"<p>Tocqu\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a9 was born in Paris.

A year later, he married Pacheco's daughter Juana and by 1621, the couple had two daughters. <br \/><br \/>During his early years in Seville, Vel\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a1zquez produced traditional religious works such as The Immaculate Conception or Saint John the Evangelist on Patmos, and 'bodegones' - literally 'tavern scenes' or paintings of everyday life. Occasionally, and more unusually, he combined the two. His picture of Christ in the House of Martha and Mary is a kitchen scene, but on the back wall is a hatch revealing Christ addressing Mary in the background.<\/p>\nThe rise to court artist\n<p>In 1623, thanks to his father-in-law's connections, Vel\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a1zquez was asked to paint a portrait of the young King Philip IV. Philip was so delighted with the result that he immediately appointed Vel\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a1zquez as one of his court painters, and from then on would allow no one else to paint him. <br \/><br \/>The move to the royal court in Madrid allowed Vel\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a1zquez access to the impressive royal collection. Vel\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a1zquez studied the Italian paintings, particularly those by Venetian artists such as Titian. When Rubens arrived in Madrid on a diplomatic mission in 1628, the two artists became well acquainted. In 1629, Vel\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a1zquez obtained permission to visit Italy himself and study Italian painting. He also sought out new paintings to buy on behalf of the King. <br \/><br \/>The National Gallery's Christ Contemplated by the Christian Soul was painted shortly after his return in 1631. Its loosely painted technique shows a distinctly Venetian influence.<\/p>\nHigh office\n<p>Vel\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a1zquez was not just successful as a painter. From his arrival he had continued to rise up the ranks in the royal household. In 1636 he was made Assistant to the Wardrobe - a position of trust and responsibility. <br \/><br \/>He continued to be busy with commissions however, producing paintings for the new Palacio del Buen Retiro, and other residencies. A large proportion of his work was made up of royal portraits of the king and his family including the queen, their children, and their court jesters and dwarfs. <br \/><br \/>In 1643 Vel\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a1zquez was promoted again, to Gentleman of the Bedchamber. He was also made superintendent of the palace works. In 1647 he was put in charge of a project to modernise the old Alc\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a1zar palace. <br \/><br \/>In 1649 Vel\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a1zquez made a second journey to Italy to buy paintings and keep himself up-to-date with developments in Italian art. While there he painted several portraits, including one of Pope Innocent X. He also had an affair resulting in an illegitimate child which considerably delayed his return to Spain - much to the king's annoyance. While there, he also painted the famous Rokeby Venus for an important Spanish nobleman, the Marques de Eliche.<\/p>\nThe Golden Age\n<p>The 17th century was the 'Siglo de Oro' or 'Golden Age' for art and literature in Spain. Vel\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a1zquez painted while Cervantes wrote 'Don Quixote' and Lope de Vega wrote his plays. This was despite the religious and political wars that drained the Spanish economy, and the devastating outbreaks of plague. <br \/><br \/>Vel\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a1zquez was promoted to increasingly senior administrative positions which left him less time for painting. His son-in-law, Juan Bautista Martinez de Mazo became increasingly involved in helping out by making official copies of his pictures. <br \/><br \/>Vel\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a1zquez's close relationship with the king and his family continued. Having created a group of mythological scenes for the Alc\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a1zar palace, the artist's last years were mostly taken up with royal portraits such as the Gallery's Philip IV of Spain. In his most famous work, 'Las Meninas' (The Maids of Honour) he shows himself at work in the court. <br \/><br \/>In 1658 Vel\u00c3\u0083\u00c2\u00a1zquez was made a Knight of Santiago. It was an honour he had always desired and his badge of office has been added to his self-portrait in 'Las Meninas'. Two years later, in 1660, he fell ill and died, followed by his wife just a week later.<\/p>","objects":{"000-01AQ-0000":"NG1375","000-01AW-0000":"NG1148","000-01D6-0000":"NG2057","000-02Z0-0000":"NG6264","000-030E-0000":"NG6424","000-031D-0000":"NG6380","000-03FU-0000":"NG197","000-03VH-0000":"NG745","000-0451-0000":"NG1129"},"artists":[],"date_range":{"begin":"1618-01-01","end":"1658-12-31"},"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0002-0000":"Christianity","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0004-0000":"Men","00A-0005-0000":"Women","00A-0006-0000":"Worship","00A-0008-0000":"Robes","00A-000B-0000":"Animals","00A-000D-0000":"Landscapes","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000I-0000":"Mythology","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-0012-0000":"Aristocracy","00A-0013-0000":"Kings","00A-001D-0000":"Saints","00A-001F-0000":"Books","00A-001J-0000":"Portraits","00A-001X-0000":"Spanish","00A-0023-0000":"Children","00A-002B-0000":"Furniture","00A-002J-0000":"Sports","00A-002K-0000":"Dogs","00A-0035-0000":"Home","00A-003C-0000":"Fish","00A-003P-0000":"Hunters","00A-003Q-0000":"Horses","00A-003T-0000":"Jewellery","00A-003Y-0000":"Thinking","00A-004H-0000":"History","00A-004W-0000":"Leisure","00A-004Z-0000":"Food","00A-0055-0000":"Goddesses","00A-0059-0000":"Spain","00A-005A-0000":"Carriages","00A-006S-0000":"Cooking","00A-008M-0000":"Eggs"},"artist_type":"normal","artist_class":"other","ArtistDisplayDate":"1599 - 1660","pdate":[["born","standard",["1599-01-01","1599-12-31","1599",{"within":["1590s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["16th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]],["died","standard",["1660-01-01","1660-12-31","1660",{"within":["1660s"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},{"within":["17th Century"],"overlaps":[],"contains":[]},"year",""]]]},"001-0455-0000":{"type":"artist","pid":"001-0455-0000","name":"Adriaen van de Velde","title":"","description":"<p>Adriaen van de Velde was the younger brother of the marine painter, Willem van de Velde the Younger.

His father was a stonecutter and his mother was the illegitimate daughter of a nobleman called Caliari, a name the artist adopted in the 1550s. Veronese moved to Venice in the early 1550s and stayed there for the rest of his life, becoming one of the leading painters of the 16th century. <br><br>He was trained in Verona by Antonio Badile (about 1518\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u00931560) whose daughter he married in 1566. Subsequently, it seems he served a stint in the studio of Giovanni Battista Caroto (1488\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0093about 1563\/6). The roots of his style may be located in the antique architecture and sculpture of Verona, but are ultimately his own synthesis of Central and Northern Italian influences.<\/p>\n<p>In Venice, Titian's approach to composition, narrative, and colouring was crucial for Veronese, but his work is characterised by principles of harmony and compositional cohesion that owe as much to Raphael and the Central Italian tradition as to the Venetian. The flowing, sinuous line of Parmigianino is also an important precedent.<\/p>\n<p>Giulio Romano and his Venetian colleague and rival Tintoretto were also significant touchstones at various points of Veronese's career, but his outlook is ultimately classical and harmonious in a way we tend not to associate with their work, and what has come more broadly to be understood as Mannerism.<\/p>\n<p>For most of his career, Veronese worked for patrons, religious and secular, in Venice and the Veneto. Among his important works are the full-scale decoration of the Venetian church of S. Sebastiano (1555\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0093around 1570), his ceiling and wall paintings for the library of S. Marco (1556\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009357) and the Ducal Palace (early 1550s and 1575\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u009382), and his fresco decorations of the Villa Barbaro at Maser (around 1560), as well as a range of major altarpieces. From the 1560s onwards he also produced mythological pictures for an international clientele.<\/p>\n<p>One of his specialities were large-scale scenes of feasts, and one of these, a Last Supper painted for a Dominican friar in 1573 (now in the Accademia in Venice), provoked the Inquisition because it included a wealth of what the inquisitors perceived to be irreverent detail. Veronese defended the painter\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099s right to \u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0098take the same licence as poets and jesters take\u00c3\u00a2\u00c2\u0080\u00c2\u0099.

Some of Leonardo's artistic concerns, such as the twisting pose known as figura serpentinata, and the study of contrasting expressions, originate with Verrocchio.<br \/><br \/>Verrocchio trained as a goldsmith and went on to work as a sculptor and a painter. There is only one painting which is unanimously attributed to Verrocchio: the 'Baptism of Christ' in the Uffizi, Florence.<\/p>\n<p>However, even in this famous work, Verrocchio seems to have used an assistant (for the dove, the palm tree and the rocks on the right). The picture was later substantially reworked and finished by his former pupil Leonardo da Vinci, responsible to the angel on the left and for re-envisaging much of the landscape and the body of Christ.<\/p>\n<p>The Gallery has three works by Verrocchio and his workshop, one of which, The Virgin and Child with Two Angels, NG2508, appears to be entirely by his hand. Another later composition on the same theme, NG296, was largely executed by Verrocchio but with significant input from an assistant, almost certainly Lorenzo di Credi. A third, Tobias and the Angel, was entirely delegated to another assistant, yet to be firmly identified.<\/p>\n<p>Pietro Perugino and Lorenzo di Credi were his other main pupils and collaborators in the 1470s.
