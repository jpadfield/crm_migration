Siena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s political independence, however, was precarious. Its people believed it was the result of the decisive intervention of the Virgin Mary in a battle against Florence, Siena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s deadliest enemy, in 1260.<\/p>\n<p>The city made the Virgin Mary its queen, and in 1308 commissioned its greatest painter, Duccio, to make a large, double-sided altarpiece called the Maest\u00c3\u00a0 in her honour, for the high altar of Siena\u00e2\u0080\u0099s cathedral. The front shows the Virgin and Child in the court of Heaven, while the back \u00e2\u0080\u0093 visible only to the clergy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 tells 40 episodes from Christ\u00e2\u0080\u0099s life.<\/p>\n<p>Several paintings from the Maest\u00c3\u00a0, which was dismantled in the 18th century, are shown in this room. It became the key reference point for all subsequent Sienese painters.

His penetrating exploration of the human face ensured his position as one of the most sought-after portraitists of his time (see Room 22).<\/p>","objects":{"000-0170-0000":{"pid":"000-0170-0000","no":"NG6350"},"000-0174-0000":{"pid":"000-0174-0000","no":"NG4503"},"000-017H-0000":{"pid":"000-017H-0000","no":"NG6334"},"000-01F7-0000":{"pid":"000-01F7-0000","no":"NG6645"},"000-02TF-0000":{"pid":"000-02TF-0000","no":"NG4597"},"000-02YV-0000":{"pid":"000-02YV-0000","no":"NG6272"},"000-04JD-0000":{"pid":"000-04JD-0000","no":"NG1893"},"000-04R8-0000":{"pid":"000-04R8-0000","no":"NG3679"}},"example_object":"000-0170-0000","artists":{"001-00W6-0000":"Cornelis van Haarlem","001-01SZ-0000":"Gerrit van Honthorst","001-025H-0000":"Pieter Lastman","001-0297-0000":"Johann Liss","001-03EP-0000":"Rembrandt","001-03VW-0000":"Matthias Stom","001-04DK-0000":"Joachim Wtewael"},"date_range":{"begin":"1588-01-01","end":"1640-12-31"},"contains":[],"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0002-0000":"Christianity","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0004-0000":"Men","00A-0005-0000":"Women","00A-0008-0000":"Robes","00A-000B-0000":"Animals","00A-000C-0000":"Weapons","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000I-0000":"Mythology","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-0013-0000":"Kings","00A-0015-0000":"Angels","00A-0016-0000":"Envy","00A-0017-0000":"Anger","00A-0019-0000":"Guilt","00A-001A-0000":"Love","00A-001C-0000":"Beards","00A-001D-0000":"Saints","00A-001F-0000":"Books","00A-0023-0000":"Children","00A-0024-0000":"Infants","00A-0027-0000":"Writing","00A-002B-0000":"Furniture","00A-002T-0000":"Death","00A-0030-0000":"Dutch","00A-003K-0000":"Goats","00A-003L-0000":"Language","00A-003T-0000":"Jewellery","00A-0041-0000":"Beauty","00A-0045-0000":"Cupids","00A-004B-0000":"Arrows","00A-004F-0000":"Conflict","00A-004X-0000":"Gold","00A-004Z-0000":"Food","00A-0055-0000":"Goddesses","00A-005P-0000":"Inscriptions","00A-0063-0000":"Blood","00A-007N-0000":"Silver"}},"006-000G-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-000G-0000","name":"Room 14","title":"The Netherlands","description":"<p>Portraits by Netherlandish artists reveal a range of approaches to characterisation, from the delicacy of Catharina van Hemessen to the boldness of Lucas van Leyden and the frankness of Gossaert.

Until the late 19th century he was celebrated as the prime model for aspiring artists. Raphael\u00e2\u0080\u0099s work as a portraitist and painter of Madonnas, as well as his charm, brought him fame.<\/p>\n<p>From 1500 to 1508 Raphael was active all over central Italy, in Siena, Florence and Perugia. There, he worked alongside Perugino, who was once described as a \u00e2\u0080\u0098divine painter\u00e2\u0080\u0099 by Raphael\u00e2\u0080\u0099s father. In 1508 Raphael was called to Rome, to work for Pope Julius II. Here he evolved into an artist of universal talents, as successful as an architect and designer as a painter.<\/p>\n<p>As a young man, Raphael had been inspired by another central Italian painter with equally wide interests \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Piero della Francesca. Piero, from the small Tuscan town of Borgo Sansepolcro, was a talented mathematician. It is thought that Raphael, Perugino and Luca Signorelli all looked to Piero\u00e2\u0080\u0099s geometrical, ordered compositions that refine and perfect the natural world. Like Raphael, he worked for some of the most powerful men in Italy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 noble courts, powerful merchants, popes and their entourages. His reputation, however, fell into obscurity after his death.<\/p>\n<p>Today, Piero della Francesca and Raphael are two of the most admired of Renaissance Italian painters.

Erotic art broke beyond the mythological or low-life to include subjects that were recognisably contemporary.<\/p>\r\n<p>Many painters adopted a lighter palette, frothier brushwork and swirling compositions. These better suited the interior decoration of the period, which was dominated by pale shades, mirrors and delicate carved wood. The 1780s saw a reaction to this.

Churchmen and women, and members of the social elite, owned small images of Christian subjects to stimulate private prayer and devotion; an outstanding example of which is The Wilton Diptych.<\/p>\n<p>Italian painting of this period is indebted to the art of the Byzantine Empire. Byzantine icons (sacred images of Christ, the Virgin Mary and the saints) were venerated across the Italian peninsula. Their gilded backgrounds and deep colours were an inspiration to many painters. So, too, were the subjects they depicted. For instance, the depiction of Christ as the Man of Sorrows \u00e2\u0080\u0093 first developed in Byzantine art of the 12th century \u00e2\u0080\u0093 was much copied in Italy.<\/p>\n<p>In the late 13th and early 14th centuries, painters across Italy strove to inject a new, naturalistic spirit into painting. Cimabue, for instance, shows the Christ Child as a real baby, clinging to his mother\u00e2\u0080\u0099s hand. Giotto, who may have been Cimabue\u00e2\u0080\u0099s pupil, gives his figures monumentality and gravity, often placing them within convincing architectural spaces.<\/p>","objects":{"000-018S-0000":{"pid":"000-018S-0000","no":"NG6573"},"000-018Y-0000":{"pid":"000-018Y-0000","no":"NG6572"},"000-019D-0000":{"pid":"000-019D-0000","no":"NG564"},"000-01DS-0000":{"pid":"000-01DS-0000","no":"NG3893"},"000-02N6-0000":{"pid":"000-02N6-0000","no":"NG5115"},"000-02NO-0000":{"pid":"000-02NO-0000","no":"NG5360"},"000-02T3-0000":{"pid":"000-02T3-0000","no":"NG4451"},"000-02UQ-0000":{"pid":"000-02UQ-0000","no":"NG6503"},"000-030U-0000":{"pid":"000-030U-0000","no":"NG6361"},"000-0349-0000":{"pid":"000-0349-0000","no":"NG6571"},"000-03JL-0000":{"pid":"000-03JL-0000","no":"NG6583"},"000-03V0-0000":{"pid":"000-03V0-0000","no":"NG752"},"000-04PE-0000":{"pid":"000-04PE-0000","no":"NG3897"},"000-04PG-0000":{"pid":"000-04PG-0000","no":"NG3895"},"000-04SE-0000":{"pid":"000-04SE-0000","no":"NG2927"}},"example_object":"000-02T3-0000","artists":{"001-003O-0000":"Andrea di Bonaiuto da Firenze","001-009L-0000":"Barnaba da Modena","001-00SJ-0000":"Cimabue","001-01C6-0000":"Francesco da Rimini","001-0295-0000":"Lippo di Dalmasio","001-02AE-0000":"Lorenzo Veneziano","001-02DL-0000":"Margarito d'Arezzo","001-02F2-0000":"Master of Saint Francis","001-02FD-0000":"Master of the Borgo Crucifix (Master of the Franciscan Crucifixes)","001-02FH-0000":"Master of the Clarisse (possibly Rinaldo da Siena)"},"date_range":{"begin":"1253-01-01","end":"1402-12-31"},"contains":[],"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0002-0000":"Christianity","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0004-0000":"Men","00A-0005-0000":"Women","00A-0006-0000":"Worship","00A-0007-0000":"Kneeling","00A-0008-0000":"Robes","00A-000B-0000":"Animals","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000J-0000":"Gifts","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000P-0000":"Families","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-0015-0000":"Angels","00A-0018-0000":"Grief","00A-001A-0000":"Love","00A-001C-0000":"Beards","00A-001D-0000":"Saints","00A-001F-0000":"Books","00A-001J-0000":"Portraits","00A-001V-0000":"Youth","00A-0023-0000":"Children","00A-0028-0000":"Churches","00A-0029-0000":"Mourning","00A-002D-0000":"Boys","00A-002T-0000":"Death","00A-002Z-0000":"Thieves","00A-003B-0000":"Worshipers","00A-003H-0000":"Deer","00A-003T-0000":"Jewellery","00A-004X-0000":"Gold","00A-0057-0000":"Apple","00A-005P-0000":"Inscriptions","00A-005R-0000":"Sailors","00A-005T-0000":"Donors","00A-0063-0000":"Blood","00A-006M-0000":"Symbols","00A-006U-0000":"Tombs","00A-007R-0000":"Devils"}},"006-000P-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-000P-0000","name":"Room 38","title":"Canaletto and Guardi","description":"<p>Paintings portraying the grandeur of Venice became popular at the dawn of modern tourism.

The rise of what became one of the most characteristic themes of Dutch art can be linked to several contemporary developments: a growing scientific interest in botany and horticulture, including the establishment of botanical gardens for academic study; and a booming international trade in exotic cultivars. In the 1630s, so-called \u00e2\u0080\u0098tulip mania\u00e2\u0080\u0099 saw speculative prices for the most coveted bulbs and flowering plants reach astonishing heights. Their value soon crashed, but the Dutch enchantment with flowers endured.<\/p>\n<p>Jan Brueghel the Elder and Ambrosius Bosschaert the Elder were among the first artists to paint pictures that exclusively depicted flowers. These early flower paintings feature flat, symmetrical arrangements of flowers from different seasons, with each prized specimen and adventuresome insect clearly visible. Later in the 17th century, artists like Jan Davidsz. de Heem and Rachel Ruysch ventured more relaxed bouquets, with asymmetrical rhythms, dramatic lighting, and even the most costly flowers overlapping to create a sense of

cultural centres. The city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s currency, the florin, was central to international commerce, and Florentines dominated the continent\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wool trade.<\/p>\n<p>Even the Black Death, a catastrophic outbreak of bubonic plague, to which all of Europe succumbed in the late 1340s, did not put an end to the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s rise.<\/p>\n<p>Florence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s wealth meant that there was a ready market for art in the city. Many of the paintings in this room were made as parts of altarpieces, to play a role in Christian worship in the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s numerous parish churches, monasteries and convents \u00e2\u0080\u0093 numbering 110 in 1338. Jacopo di Cione\u00e2\u0080\u0099s altarpiece (reconstituted on the large wall of this room) for the high altar of the abbey church of the Benedictine nuns of San Pier Maggiore shows the opulence and grandeur of such commissions. The Florentines who paid for it \u00e2\u0080\u0093 probably members of the noble Albizzi family \u00e2\u0080\u0093 hoped in return for a place in the nuns\u00e2\u0080\u0099 prayers.<\/p>\n<p>Florentine painters, well into the fifteenth century, were inspired by the example of their compatriot Giotto, by Duccio and other Sienese artists, and by contemporary sculptors. They strove to produce works which gave a sense of the divine, and yet were both naturalistic and

In Rome, Pompeo Girolamo Batoni became the portrait painter of choice for British Grand Tourists, often depicting his sitters alongside the works of classical antiquity they had travelled to admire. Other artists, such as Canaletto in Venice and Giovanni Paolo Panini in Rome, painted souvenir views of their respective cities. Bernardo Bellotto was unusual for enacting a Grand Tour in reverse, taking the meticulous and evocative mode of view painting he had learned in his uncle Canaletto\u00e2\u0080\u0099s studio to the court cities of northern Europe.<\/p>","objects":[],"example_object":false,"artists":[],"date_range":[],"contains":[],"keywords":[]},"006-0018-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-0018-0000","name":"Room 29","title":"French Painting 1600\u00e2\u0080\u00931700 ","description":"<p>In the 17th century, political ambitions to make of Paris a new Rome resulted in more French-born painters making their careers in the French capital. This trend was encouraged by the founding in 1648 of a royal academy of the arts, and by many wealthy individuals refurbishing their homes. Paintings such as Philippe de Champaigne\u00e2\u0080\u0099s full-length portrait of Cardinal de Richelieu make manifest the increasing power and self-confidence that was felt in France in this period.\u00c2\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>The most important French painter of the 17th century, however, did not live in Paris. Nicolas Poussin settled in Rome in 1624, where his style was shaped primarily by antique and Renaissance art. Poussin adapted Titian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s loose brushwork and harmonious colouring, often arranging his figures in a triangular composition. From about 1630, he took greater inspiration from paintings by Raphael and from antique sculpture. In The Adoration of the Golden Calf, for example, his figures are arranged frieze-like across the surface of the picture.<\/p>\n<p>Claude Gell\u00c3\u00a9e, also known as Claude Lorrain, was the most successful landscape painter of the 17th century. Among his patrons were numerous members of European nobility, including Philip IV of Spain and Pope Urban VIII. Claude specialised in idealised landscapes and port scenes, in which he often mixed the real with the fictive. His great innovation was painting the sun facing the viewer.<\/p>\n","objects":{"000-0188-0000":{"pid":"000-0188-0000","no":"NG4919"},"000-019E-0000":{"pid":"000-019E-0000","no":"NG2"},"000-02P4-0000":{"pid":"000-02P4-0000","no":"NG5593"},"000-02PC-0000":{"pid":"000-02PC-0000","no":"NG5597"},"000-02PI-0000":{"pid":"000-02PI-0000","no":"NG5472"},"000-02PQ-0000":{"pid":"000-02PQ-0000","no":"NG5763"},"000-02ST-0000":{"pid":"000-02ST-0000","no":"NG4857"},"000-02UD-0000":{"pid":"000-02UD-0000","no":"NG6519"},"000-02UR-0000":{"pid":"000-02UR-0000","no":"NG6513"},"000-02VD-0000":{"pid":"000-02VD-0000","no":"NG6477"},"000-02XW-0000":{"pid":"000-02XW-0000","no":"NG6331"},"000-02YB-0000":{"pid":"000-02YB-0000","no":"NG6329"},"000-02YR-0000":{"pid":"000-02YR-0000","no":"NG6277"},"000-02Z1-0000":{"pid":"000-02Z1-0000","no":"NG6276"},"000-02ZJ-0000":{"pid":"000-02ZJ-0000","no":"NG6299"},"000-032G-0000":{"pid":"000-032G-0000","no":"NG6548"},"000-03JC-0000":{"pid":"000-03JC-0000","no":"NG6"},"000-03K7-0000":{"pid":"000-03K7-0000","no":"NG19"},"000-03M6-0000":{"pid":"000-03M6-0000","no":"NG161"},"000-03MP-0000":{"pid":"000-03MP-0000","no":"NG58"},"000-03MV-0000":{"pid":"000-03MV-0000","no":"NG61"},"000-03N4-0000":{"pid":"000-03N4-0000","no":"NG39"},"000-03NP-0000":{"pid":"000-03NP-0000","no":"NG65"},"000-03NQ-0000":{"pid":"000-03NQ-0000","no":"NG64"},"000-03U1-0000":{"pid":"000-03U1-0000","no":"NG798"},"000-03YG-0000":{"pid":"000-03YG-0000","no":"NG1449"},"000-03YU-0000":{"pid":"000-03YU-0000","no":"NG1425"},"000-04PL-0000":{"pid":"000-04PL-0000","no":"NG3879"},"000-04S3-0000":{"pid":"000-04S3-0000","no":"NG2967"}},"example_object":"000-03YG-0000","artists":{"001-00QJ-0000":"Philippe de Champaigne","001-00T6-0000":"Claude","001-014E-0000":"Gaspard Dughet","001-024H-0000":"Laurent de La Hyre","001-0261-0000":"The Le Nain Brothers","001-0266-0000":"Eustache Le Sueur","001-02JH-0000":"Pierre Mignard","001-02JT-0000":"Francisque Millet","001-034S-0000":"Pierre Patel","001-03AA-0000":"Nicolas Poussin","001-044N-0000":"Valentin de Boulogne"},"date_range":{"begin":"1626-01-01","end":"1691-12-31"},"contains":[],"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0002-0000":"Christianity","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0004-0000":"Men","00A-0005-0000":"Women","00A-0006-0000":"Worship","00A-0007-0000":"Kneeling","00A-0008-0000":"Robes","00A-000B-0000":"Animals","00A-000C-0000":"Weapons","00A-000D-0000":"Landscapes","00A-000E-0000":"Rivers","00A-000F-0000":"Plants","00A-000G-0000":"Water","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000I-0000":"Mythology","00A-000J-0000":"Gifts","00A-000K-0000":"French","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000M-0000":"Playing","00A-000N-0000":"Musical instruments","00A-000O-0000":"Music","00A-000P-0000":"Families","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-000R-0000":"Shepherds","00A-000S-0000":"Buildings","00A-000T-0000":"Transportation","00A-000W-0000":"Transport","00A-0010-0000":"Soldiers","00A-0011-0000":"Warriors","00A-0012-0000":"Aristocracy","00A-0013-0000":"Kings","00A-0014-0000":"Greed","00A-0015-0000":"Angels","00A-0017-0000":"Anger","00A-0018-0000":"Grief","00A-001B-0000":"Masks","00A-001C-0000":"Beards","00A-001D-0000":"Saints","00A-001F-0000":"Books","00A-001H-0000":"Reading","00A-001J-0000":"Portraits","00A-001N-0000":"Celebrations","00A-001Q-0000":"Lakes","00A-001R-0000":"Bridges","00A-001S-0000":"Temples","00A-001V-0000":"Youth","00A-001W-0000":"Birds","00A-0022-0000":"Sacrifices","00A-0023-0000":"Children","00A-0024-0000":"Infants","00A-0025-0000":"Happiness","00A-002B-0000":"Furniture","00A-002D-0000":"Boys","00A-002E-0000":"Rituals","00A-002F-0000":"Ceremonies","00A-002G-0000":"Vegetation","00A-002K-0000":"Dogs","00A-002U-0000":"Dance","00A-003B-0000":"Worshipers","00A-003D-0000":"Sculpture","00A-003F-0000":"Weather","00A-003H-0000":"Deer","00A-003K-0000":"Goats","00A-003N-0000":"Prophecy","00A-003O-0000":"Nymphs","00A-003R-0000":"Oxen","00A-003S-0000":"Sons","00A-003T-0000":"Jewellery","00A-0042-0000":"Satyrs","00A-0049-0000":"Girls","00A-004H-0000":"History","00A-004Z-0000":"Food","00A-0052-0000":"Bread","00A-0056-0000":"Daughters","00A-005D-0000":"Poverty","00A-005I-0000":"Pots","00A-005K-0000":"Footwear","00A-005M-0000":"Shoes","00A-005Y-0000":"Mortality","00A-0062-0000":"Cloaks","00A-0079-0000":"Tools","00A-0084-0000":"Fertility","00A-0090-0000":"Achilles"}},"006-0019-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-0019-0000","name":"Room 23","title":"Dutch portraiture","description":"<p>Dutch citizens from the newly affluent mercantile class were as keen to commission portraits of themselves and their families as were their aristocratic counterparts. In accordance with Calvinist tradition, Dutch sitters were mindful not to come across as too ostentatious, wearing predominantly black clothing and often posing in neutral surroundings. Their portraits therefore lack the showiness seen in Baroque portraits by artists such as Van Dyck (see Room 21). Yet the discerning observer would have understood that the refined if muted elegance of the sitter\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clothing signalled their high social status.

Regardless of the identity of the sitter, the primary function of a portrait was to capture likeness and inner virtue, denoting that the sitter was worthy of the honour of being portrayed and in time, remembered.<\/p>\n<p>Moretto and Moroni are among the finest representatives of the naturalistic approach that characterised 16th-century Lombard painting, and especially portraiture. Moretto worked primarily in Brescia, while his one-time student Moroni was the preeminent portraitist in Bergamo in the 1550s and 1560s, and after that in nearby Albino, his hometown. His portraits are characterised by acute psychological penetration, as well as great clarity of presentation.<\/p>\n<p>Lotto was one of the leading Venetian painters of the earlier 16th century, although he worked mainly outside Venice, in part because the competition for commissions there was so intense. This exposed him to a broad range of influences, from Lombard naturalism to Raphael\u00e2\u0080\u0099s High Renaissance Classicism. This might help explain why he is one of the most individualistic of the great Italian painters. His works are characterised by the use of deeply saturated colours and bold shadow, and his portraits are among the most empathetic of their time.<\/p>","objects":{"000-01DI-0000":{"pid":"000-01DI-0000","no":"NG2281"},"000-03IY-0000":{"pid":"000-03IY-0000","no":"NG299"},"000-03RK-0000":{"pid":"000-03RK-0000","no":"NG697"},"000-03S3-0000":{"pid":"000-03S3-0000","no":"NG699"},"000-03UZ-0000":{"pid":"000-03UZ-0000","no":"NG742"},"000-0414-0000":{"pid":"000-0414-0000","no":"NG1047"},"000-042G-0000":{"pid":"000-042G-0000","no":"NG1025"},"000-042H-0000":{"pid":"000-042H-0000","no":"NG1024"},"000-042I-0000":{"pid":"000-042I-0000","no":"NG1023"},"000-042J-0000":{"pid":"000-042J-0000","no":"NG1022"},"000-0443-0000":{"pid":"000-0443-0000","no":"NG1105"},"000-04FJ-0000":{"pid":"000-04FJ-0000","no":"NG2494"},"000-04MK-0000":{"pid":"000-04MK-0000","no":"NG2094"},"000-04U2-0000":{"pid":"000-04U2-0000","no":"NG3128"},"000-04UB-0000":{"pid":"000-04UB-0000","no":"NG3129"},"000-04UG-0000":{"pid":"000-04UG-0000","no":"NG3124"}},"example_object":"000-03RK-0000","artists":{"001-00NN-0000":"Giovanni Cariani","001-01WC-0000":"Italian, North","001-02AK-0000":"Lorenzo Lotto","001-02LU-0000":"Moretto da Brescia","001-02M5-0000":"Giovanni Battista Moroni"},"date_range":{"begin":"1513-01-01","end":"1577-12-31"},"contains":[],"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0002-0000":"Christianity","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0004-0000":"Men","00A-0006-0000":"Worship","00A-0008-0000":"Robes","00A-000C-0000":"Weapons","00A-000F-0000":"Plants","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000M-0000":"Playing","00A-000P-0000":"Families","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-0010-0000":"Soldiers","00A-0011-0000":"Warriors","00A-0012-0000":"Aristocracy","00A-001D-0000":"Saints","00A-001F-0000":"Books","00A-001J-0000":"Portraits","00A-001K-0000":"Cloth","00A-0023-0000":"Children","00A-0026-0000":"Physicians","00A-002B-0000":"Furniture","00A-002S-0000":"Swords","00A-003T-0000":"Jewellery","00A-0047-0000":"Health","00A-004H-0000":"History","00A-004R-0000":"Necklaces","00A-004S-0000":"Dress","00A-005P-0000":"Inscriptions","00A-006C-0000":"Greek","00A-006D-0000":"Fashion","00A-0079-0000":"Tools","00A-007A-0000":"Tunics"}},"006-001B-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-001B-0000","name":"Room 9","title":"Venice 1530-1600","description":"<p><strong><\/strong>Venetian painting in this period was dominated by Titian (Tiziano) and three family workshops, active both locally and internationally: those of Jacopo Tintoretto, Paolo Veronese and Jacopo Bassano.

His paintings won Titian\u00e2\u0080\u0099s praise and he attracted many commissions from the Venetian state, including paintings for the Doge\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Palace.<\/p>\n<p>By contrast, Tintoretto was initially criticised by his contemporaries for working too quickly which, they said, gave his paintings an unfinished look. But this technique enabled him to develop a dynamic style in which the rapid brushwork intensifies the dramatic impact of his daringly posed figures.<\/p>\n<p>Although Jacopo rarely left his home town Bassano on the Venetian mainland, he nonetheless attracted many patrons from Venice itself. He was famed for his depictions of biblical subjects, which he set in realistic rustic surroundings with vivid depictions of animals and rural

After an apprenticeship with Hendrick van Balen, he entered Rubens\u00e2\u0080\u0099s studio to assist the master in painting biblical and mythological subjects, but Van Dyck is best known today for the grace and exuberance of his later portraits. Between 1621 and 1627 he made Italy his home, where he received important commissions from the aristocracy of Genoa and the bishops and cardinals of Rome. Back in Antwerp he was equally in demand as a portrait painter. Like Rubens, Van Dyck ran a large workshop in order to meet high demand, often leaving the less important parts of his portraits to studio assistants.<\/p>\n<p>King Charles I of England\u00c2\u00a0invited Van Dyck to London and knighted him in 1632. The artist became the ultimate visual chronicler of life at the English court, and to this day, his portraits of British aristocrats can be found in most major country house collections. Van Dyck\u00e2\u0080\u0099s elegant portraiture had a lasting influence on portrait painting throughout Europe, but nowhere more than in England.<\/p>","objects":{"000-02OJ-0000":{"pid":"000-02OJ-0000","no":"NG5633"},"000-02SR-0000":{"pid":"000-02SR-0000","no":"NG4889"},"000-02U3-0000":{"pid":"000-02U3-0000","no":"NG6502"},"000-030I-0000":{"pid":"000-030I-0000","no":"NG6364"},"000-030S-0000":{"pid":"000-030S-0000","no":"NG6363"},"000-032R-0000":{"pid":"000-032R-0000","no":"NG6567"},"000-03MU-0000":{"pid":"000-03MU-0000","no":"NG52"},"000-03QX-0000":{"pid":"000-03QX-0000","no":"NG877.2"},"000-042S-0000":{"pid":"000-042S-0000","no":"NG1012"},"000-044U-0000":{"pid":"000-044U-0000","no":"NG1137"},"000-04N2-0000":{"pid":"000-04N2-0000","no":"NG2144"},"000-04QD-0000":{"pid":"000-04QD-0000","no":"NG3605"},"000-04S0-0000":{"pid":"000-04S0-0000","no":"NG3011"}},"example_object":"000-030S-0000","artists":{"001-0157-0000":"Anthony van Dyck","001-030O-0000":"Jacob van Oost the Elder"},"date_range":{"begin":"1618-01-01","end":"1652-12-31"},"contains":[],"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0002-0000":"Christianity","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0004-0000":"Men","00A-0006-0000":"Worship","00A-000C-0000":"Weapons","00A-000F-0000":"Plants","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000M-0000":"Playing","00A-000N-0000":"Musical instruments","00A-000O-0000":"Music","00A-000P-0000":"Families","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-000T-0000":"Transportation","00A-000W-0000":"Transport","00A-0012-0000":"Aristocracy","00A-001A-0000":"Love","00A-001J-0000":"Portraits","00A-001L-0000":"Italian","00A-001W-0000":"Birds","00A-0023-0000":"Children","00A-002D-0000":"Boys","00A-002S-0000":"Swords","00A-003T-0000":"Jewellery","00A-0045-0000":"Cupids","00A-004H-0000":"History","00A-004W-0000":"Leisure","00A-005K-0000":"Footwear","00A-005M-0000":"Shoes","00A-006F-0000":"Travellers","00A-0089-0000":"English","00A-008P-0000":"Princes"}},"006-001J-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-001J-0000","name":"Room A Wall 02","title":"","description":"","objects":[],"example_object":false,"artists":[],"date_range":[],"contains":[],"keywords":[]},"006-001K-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-001K-0000","name":"Room 6","title":"Room closed","description":"","objects":{"000-02ZT-0000":{"pid":"000-02ZT-0000","no":"NG6420"},"000-05UW-0000":{"pid":"000-05UW-0000","no":"NG6611"},"000-05UX-0000":{"pid":"000-05UX-0000","no":"NG6616"}},"example_object":"000-05UW-0000","artists":{"001-0419-0000":"Titian"},"date_range":{"begin":"1556-01-01","end":"1577-12-31"},"contains":[],"keywords":{"00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0008-0000":"Robes","00A-000B-0000":"Animals","00A-000E-0000":"Rivers","00A-000F-0000":"Plants","00A-000G-0000":"Water","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000I-0000":"Mythology","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-0017-0000":"Anger","00A-002K-0000":"Dogs","00A-002T-0000":"Death","00A-003G-0000":"Bathing","00A-008T-0000":"Titian"}},"006-001L-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-001L-0000","name":"Room 55","title":"Venice and the Veneto, 1460\u00e2\u0080\u00931510","description":"<p>During the second half of the 15th century, the Republic of Venice was one of Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most important and populous centres. Venice\u00e2\u0080\u0099s merchants and navy controlled almost all Western trade in the Eastern Mediterranean. In competition with the Ottoman Turks, who had conquered Constantinople in 1453, Venice laid claim to the former territories of the Byzantine Empire.<\/p>\n<p>Venetian paintings of this period reflect a taste that was shaped by the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s international connections. Art in the Byzantine style, notably the mosaics that adorned the Basilica of San Marco, provided the bedrock of Venetian painting. Contemporary Northern European pictures, particularly by Jan van Eyck, Dirk Bouts and Hans Memling, were avidly collected by Venetians. They admired their mastery of painting in oil, and their precise rendering of naturalistic detail. In the mid-1470s, when the Southern Italian painter, Antonello da Messina, visited Venice, his Netherlandish-inspired art made a sensation.<\/p>\n<p>For much of this period, the Bellini family ran the city\u00e2\u0080\u0099s most important painting workshop, supplying everything from manuscript illuminations to large-scale altarpieces. While Gentile Bellini was the official portraitist to successive Doges of Venice, his younger brother, Giovanni, was a more talented artist. His skill as a<br \/>painter of atmospheric, light-filled landscapes paved the way for an entire generation of artists, including Giorgione and Titian.<\/p>","objects":{"000-019L-0000":{"pid":"000-019L-0000","no":"NG281"},"000-01A1-0000":{"pid":"000-01A1-0000","no":"NG599"},"000-01B3-0000":{"pid":"000-01B3-0000","no":"NG1120"},"000-01BV-0000":{"pid":"000-01BV-0000","no":"NG1233"},"000-03G0-0000":{"pid":"000-03G0-0000","no":"NG189"},"000-03IG-0000":{"pid":"000-03IG-0000","no":"NG280"},"000-03S6-0000":{"pid":"000-03S6-0000","no":"NG726"},"000-03TF-0000":{"pid":"000-03TF-0000","no":"NG673"},"000-03UV-0000":{"pid":"000-03UV-0000","no":"NG812"},"000-0406-0000":{"pid":"000-0406-0000","no":"NG1418"},"000-0408-0000":{"pid":"000-0408-0000","no":"NG1417"},"000-0435-0000":{"pid":"000-0435-0000","no":"NG1166"},"000-044Q-0000":{"pid":"000-044Q-0000","no":"NG1141"},"000-04GA-0000":{"pid":"000-04GA-0000","no":"NG2503"},"000-0C1O-0000":{"pid":"000-0C1O-0000","no":"NG6655"}},"example_object":"000-0406-0000","artists":{"001-0051-0000":"Antonello da Messina","001-00C0-0000":"Giovanni Bellini","001-00SI-0000":"Giovanni Battista Cima da Conegliano","001-01WJ-0000":"Italian, Venetian","001-02DB-0000":"Andrea Mantegna","001-03RU-0000":"Antonio de Solario"},"date_range":{"begin":"1453-01-01","end":"1512-12-31"},"contains":[],"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0002-0000":"Christianity","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0004-0000":"Men","00A-0006-0000":"Worship","00A-0007-0000":"Kneeling","00A-0008-0000":"Robes","00A-000B-0000":"Animals","00A-000C-0000":"Weapons","00A-000D-0000":"Landscapes","00A-000F-0000":"Plants","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000P-0000":"Families","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-000S-0000":"Buildings","00A-0010-0000":"Soldiers","00A-0015-0000":"Angels","00A-0017-0000":"Anger","00A-0019-0000":"Guilt","00A-001D-0000":"Saints","00A-001F-0000":"Books","00A-001H-0000":"Reading","00A-001J-0000":"Portraits","00A-001R-0000":"Bridges","00A-001U-0000":"Motherhood","00A-001W-0000":"Birds","00A-0023-0000":"Children","00A-002B-0000":"Furniture","00A-002D-0000":"Boys","00A-002I-0000":"Sleep","00A-002S-0000":"Swords","00A-002T-0000":"Death","00A-003A-0000":"Fruit","00A-003B-0000":"Worshipers","00A-0044-0000":"Caves","00A-004H-0000":"History","00A-006B-0000":"Latin","00A-0076-0000":"Wood","00A-008K-0000":"Immortality"}},"006-001M-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-001M-0000","name":"Room 30","title":"Spain","description":"<p>Spanish painting flourished during the 17th century principally in the service of God and King.

His paintings of such subjects as Marriage A-la-Mode were reproduced as commercially successful engravings, but his rich and subtle characterisation is most fully evident in the original paintings.

His extraordinarily assured painting technique conveys a directness and sympathy for his subject.<\/p>","objects":{"000-017R-0000":{"pid":"000-017R-0000","no":"NG6301"},"000-018K-0000":{"pid":"000-018K-0000","no":"NG5984"},"000-018Q-0000":{"pid":"000-018Q-0000","no":"NG6547"},"000-01BD-0000":{"pid":"000-01BD-0000","no":"NG925"},"000-01DD-0000":{"pid":"000-01DD-0000","no":"NG1811"}},"example_object":"000-017R-0000","artists":{"001-01E9-0000":"Thomas Gainsborough"},"date_range":{"begin":"1746-01-01","end":"1758-12-31"},"contains":[],"keywords":{"00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0009-0000":"Sisters","00A-000B-0000":"Animals","00A-000C-0000":"Weapons","00A-000D-0000":"Landscapes","00A-000F-0000":"Plants","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000M-0000":"Playing","00A-000P-0000":"Families","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-001J-0000":"Portraits","00A-0023-0000":"Children","00A-0025-0000":"Happiness","00A-002C-0000":"Pets","00A-003H-0000":"Deer","00A-003U-0000":"Friendship","00A-003V-0000":"Friends","00A-0049-0000":"Girls","00A-004A-0000":"Dresses","00A-004G-0000":"Coats","00A-004H-0000":"History","00A-004S-0000":"Dress","00A-0056-0000":"Daughters","00A-005K-0000":"Footwear","00A-005M-0000":"Shoes"}},"006-001O-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-001O-0000","name":"Room 59","title":"Florence under the Medici, 1434\u00e2\u0080\u009394","description":"<p>In 1434, Cosimo de\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Medici returned to Florence from exile. His control of Europe\u00e2\u0080\u0099s largest banking enterprise and a vast patronage network enabled him to take<br \/>control of the city. For the next 60 years, his family would remain Florence\u00e2\u0080\u0099s de facto rulers. Cosimo, his son Piero, and grandson Lorenzo used artistic commissions to bolster the Medici\u00e2\u0080\u0099s prestige and authority.<\/p>\n<p>The Medici paid for lavish and innovative architecture, sculpture, and painting \u00e2\u0080\u0093 for private spaces such as their family palace; for churches and monasteries including the Dominican convent of San Marco and the Medici family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s parish church of San Lorenzo; and for civic buildings like the Palazzo della Signoria.<\/p>\n<p>Medici support promoted the careers of a number of pioneering Florentine artists, including Donatello, Filippo Lippi, Verrocchio, the Pollaiuolo brothers and Botticelli. In very different ways, they were inspired by classical antiquity, perspective, and the work of contemporary Northern European painters and sculptors to make art<br \/>that looked real and of their own world.<\/p>\n<p>Not everything went the Medici family\u00e2\u0080\u0099s way, however. Paolo Uccello\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Battle of San Romano was so coveted by Lorenzo de\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Medici that he appropriated it. Following Lorenzo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s death in 1492, his heirs were forced to return the painting to its legal owners, the Bartolini Salimbeni family.<\/p>","objects":{"000-016X-0000":{"pid":"000-016X-0000","no":"NG4428"},"000-018C-0000":{"pid":"000-018C-0000","no":"NG4868.1"},"000-018D-0000":{"pid":"000-018D-0000","no":"NG4868.3"},"000-018E-0000":{"pid":"000-018E-0000","no":"NG4868.2"},"000-018I-0000":{"pid":"000-018I-0000","no":"NG4868.4"},"000-0197-0000":{"pid":"000-0197-0000","no":"NG296"},"000-019J-0000":{"pid":"000-019J-0000","no":"NG292"},"000-019X-0000":{"pid":"000-019X-0000","no":"NG591"},"000-01A3-0000":{"pid":"000-01A3-0000","no":"NG592"},"000-01AY-0000":{"pid":"000-01AY-0000","no":"NG727"},"000-01BC-0000":{"pid":"000-01BC-0000","no":"NG781"},"000-01D9-0000":{"pid":"000-01D9-0000","no":"NG3162"},"000-01DB-0000":{"pid":"000-01DB-0000","no":"NG3230"},"000-01DK-0000":{"pid":"000-01DK-0000","no":"NG3919"},"000-031J-0000":{"pid":"000-031J-0000","no":"NG2502"},"000-03H2-0000":{"pid":"000-03H2-0000","no":"NG593"},"000-03HA-0000":{"pid":"000-03HA-0000","no":"NG583"},"000-03UP-0000":{"pid":"000-03UP-0000","no":"NG809"},"000-03VZ-0000":{"pid":"000-03VZ-0000","no":"NG758"}},"example_object":"000-03HA-0000","artists":{"001-008M-0000":"Alesso Baldovinetti","001-00GX-0000":"Sandro Botticelli","001-0293-0000":"Filippino Lippi","001-02AC-0000":"Lorenzo di Credi","001-02JB-0000":"Michelangelo","001-036D-0000":"Francesco Pesellino","001-0398-0000":"Antonio del Pollaiuolo","001-0399-0000":"Piero del Pollaiuolo","001-043T-0000":"Paolo Uccello","001-045Y-0000":"Andrea del Verrocchio"},"date_range":{"begin":"PARSEDATE: 1 abo @@1494@@<pre class=\"wrap\">Array\n(\n    [0] => about1497asearlyas1494\n    [1] => about1497asearlyas\n    [2] => 1494\n)\n<\/pre>","end":"1502-12-31"},"contains":[],"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0002-0000":"Christianity","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0004-0000":"Men","00A-0005-0000":"Women","00A-0006-0000":"Worship","00A-0007-0000":"Kneeling","00A-0008-0000":"Robes","00A-000A-0000":"Healing","00A-000B-0000":"Animals","00A-000C-0000":"Weapons","00A-000D-0000":"Landscapes","00A-000G-0000":"Water","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000I-0000":"Mythology","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000P-0000":"Families","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-000S-0000":"Buildings","00A-000T-0000":"Transportation","00A-000W-0000":"Transport","00A-0010-0000":"Soldiers","00A-0011-0000":"Warriors","00A-0013-0000":"Kings","00A-0015-0000":"Angels","00A-0017-0000":"Anger","00A-001D-0000":"Saints","00A-001J-0000":"Portraits","00A-001U-0000":"Motherhood","00A-0023-0000":"Children","00A-002D-0000":"Boys","00A-002E-0000":"Rituals","00A-002S-0000":"Swords","00A-002T-0000":"Death","00A-003B-0000":"Worshipers","00A-003Q-0000":"Horses","00A-003T-0000":"Jewellery","00A-004B-0000":"Arrows","00A-006C-0000":"Greek","00A-006Q-0000":"Mothers","00A-006R-0000":"Lions","00A-006T-0000":"Knights","00A-006V-0000":"Homer","00A-007R-0000":"Devils"}},"006-001P-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-001P-0000","name":"Room 15 Stairs","title":"","description":"","objects":{"000-03EX-0000":{"pid":"000-03EX-0000","no":"NG238"},"000-03LV-0000":{"pid":"000-03LV-0000","no":"NG95"},"000-0439-0000":{"pid":"000-0439-0000","no":"NG1159"}},"example_object":"000-0439-0000","artists":{"001-014E-0000":"Gaspard Dughet","001-02DD-0000":"Carlo Maratta","001-049S-0000":"Jan Weenix"},"date_range":{"begin":"1661-01-01","end":"1708-12-31"},"contains":[],"keywords":{"00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-000B-0000":"Animals","00A-000D-0000":"Landscapes","00A-000F-0000":"Plants","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-002K-0000":"Dogs","00A-003Q-0000":"Horses","00A-0044-0000":"Caves","00A-0045-0000":"Cupids"}},"006-001Q-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-001Q-0000","name":"Room A Wall 05","title":"","description":"","objects":[],"example_object":false,"artists":[],"date_range":[],"contains":[],"keywords":[]},"006-001R-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-001R-0000","name":"Room 21","title":"A different view of Flanders","description":"<p>Rubens\u00e2\u0080\u0099s\u00c2\u00a0landscapes present a different side of an artist who is best known for painting religious, mythological or classical subjects on commission.

In 1587 his family returned to Antwerp, where Rubens eventually converted to Catholicism. He had an enormously successful career as a learned painter of religious works expressing the Catholic reaction to the Reformation (the Counter-Reformation). Rubens was equally successful as a painter to the courts of Europe, including England, and on occasion worked as a diplomat. The ingenuity of his compositions, brilliant use of colour and his superb draughtsmanship made Rubens eminently suited to the task of dazzling audiences with the message of the Counter-Reformation.

During the early 16th century, Lodovico Mazzolino and Garofalo built upon the style and motifs of their predecessors at the Este court, with their emphasis on literary subject matter, expressive line and jewel-like colour. Later, exposure to Raphael\u00e2\u0080\u0099s paintings encouraged Garofalo to adopt a more classical style. The most original talent in Ferrara was the court painter Dosso Dossi. His striking interpretations of traditional religious subjects reveal his poetic feeling for effects of light in landscape.<\/p>\n<p>There was much interaction between Ferrara and Bologna. Although Bologna was a papal possession, the local Bentivoglio family dominated its political and artistic life. The Ferrara-born Lorenzo Costa was the favoured painter of the would-be ruler Giovanni Bentivoglio, who imitated his Este ducal neighbours by employing Ferrarese artists. The Bolognese Francesco Francia, a painter and goldsmith, was famed for the pious sweetness and calm balance of his religious paintings.<\/p>","objects":{"000-01DL-0000":{"pid":"000-01DL-0000","no":"NG2491"},"000-02NJ-0000":{"pid":"000-02NJ-0000","no":"NG5280"},"000-03BD-0000":{"pid":"000-03BD-0000","no":"NG6584"},"000-03K2-0000":{"pid":"000-03K2-0000","no":"NG24"},"000-03K9-0000":{"pid":"000-03K9-0000","no":"NG17"},"000-03R6-0000":{"pid":"000-03R6-0000","no":"NG932"},"000-03ST-0000":{"pid":"000-03ST-0000","no":"NG651"},"000-0413-0000":{"pid":"000-0413-0000","no":"NG1048"},"000-041R-0000":{"pid":"000-041R-0000","no":"NG1035"}},"example_object":"000-03ST-0000","artists":{"001-00JA-0000":"Bronzino","001-01CD-0000":"Franciabigio","001-03CC-0000":"Scipione Pulzone","001-03HM-0000":"Rosso Fiorentino","001-03LY-0000":"Andrea del Sarto","001-03OH-0000":"Sebastiano del Piombo"},"date_range":{"begin":"1508-01-01","end":"1600-12-31"},"contains":[],"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0002-0000":"Christianity","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0005-0000":"Women","00A-0008-0000":"Robes","00A-000C-0000":"Weapons","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000I-0000":"Mythology","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000P-0000":"Families","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-0010-0000":"Soldiers","00A-0011-0000":"Warriors","00A-0017-0000":"Anger","00A-001A-0000":"Love","00A-001B-0000":"Masks","00A-001D-0000":"Saints","00A-001H-0000":"Reading","00A-001J-0000":"Portraits","00A-001K-0000":"Cloth","00A-001V-0000":"Youth","00A-0023-0000":"Children","00A-0024-0000":"Infants","00A-0025-0000":"Happiness","00A-002D-0000":"Boys","00A-002S-0000":"Swords","00A-003Y-0000":"Thinking","00A-0055-0000":"Goddesses","00A-007A-0000":"Tunics"}},"006-001W-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-001W-0000","name":"Room 25","title":"A New Art For A New Nation (2)","description":"<p>Room 25 expands on the theme of Room 28; displaying prime examples of what were newly independent artistic genres, including landscape, still life, portraiture and scenes of 17th-century Dutch domestic life.<\/p>","objects":{"000-0166-0000":{"pid":"000-0166-0000","no":"NG4164"},"000-016P-0000":{"pid":"000-016P-0000","no":"NG6444"},"000-016W-0000":{"pid":"000-016W-0000","no":"NG6483"},"000-0173-0000":{"pid":"000-0173-0000","no":"NG6347"},"000-0175-0000":{"pid":"000-0175-0000","no":"NG4562"},"000-02UU-0000":{"pid":"000-02UU-0000","no":"NG6458"},"000-02WO-0000":{"pid":"000-02WO-0000","no":"NG6533"},"000-03WF-0000":{"pid":"000-03WF-0000","no":"NG1293"}},"example_object":"000-0175-0000","artists":{"001-00K7-0000":"Hendrick ter Brugghen","001-01NO-0000":"Frans Hals","001-01ZI-0000":"Willem Kalf","001-02KS-0000":"Jan Miense Molenaer","001-0425-0000":"Jan Jansz.

But despite their impression of spontaneity, these compositions were invented in the artist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s studio.<\/p>\n<p>Many Dutch innovations in landscape painting took place in Haarlem, where painters such as Cornelis Vroom and Salomon van Ruysdael spent much of their career. Van Ruysdael and Jan van Goyen, another pioneer of the naturalistic landscape, were particularly influential in the development of a tonal phase of Dutch landscape painting.<\/p>\n<p>The Dutch flat landscapes stand in stark in contrast to the compositions of the so-called Italianate painters, painters who had travelled to Italy in the early 17th century and, after their return, continued to paint landscapes dominated by warm Mediterranean light and motifs. At mid-century, Jan Both initiated a new wave of Italianate landscape painting in Holland. His style was highly influential on a second generation of Dutch Italianate painters such as Nicholaes Berchem and others, some of whom may never have travelled to Italy themselves.<\/p>","objects":[],"example_object":false,"artists":[],"date_range":[],"contains":[],"keywords":[]},"006-0020-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-0020-0000","name":"Room 16","title":"Room closed","description":"","objects":{"000-01AI-0000":{"pid":"000-01AI-0000","no":"NG1383"},"000-01AU-0000":{"pid":"000-01AU-0000","no":"NG794"},"000-01BP-0000":{"pid":"000-01BP-0000","no":"NG834"},"000-01C1-0000":{"pid":"000-01C1-0000","no":"NG3714"},"000-01CQ-0000":{"pid":"000-01CQ-0000","no":"NG3047"},"000-03NS-0000":{"pid":"000-03NS-0000","no":"NG839"},"000-03OD-0000":{"pid":"000-03OD-0000","no":"NG864"},"000-03OZ-0000":{"pid":"000-03OZ-0000","no":"NG844"},"000-03P1-0000":{"pid":"000-03P1-0000","no":"NG856"},"000-03ZG-0000":{"pid":"000-03ZG-0000","no":"NG1420"},"000-040O-0000":{"pid":"000-040O-0000","no":"NG1053"},"000-0426-0000":{"pid":"000-0426-0000","no":"NG992"},"000-042U-0000":{"pid":"000-042U-0000","no":"NG1010"},"000-04GH-0000":{"pid":"000-04GH-0000","no":"NG2531"},"000-04IC-0000":{"pid":"000-04IC-0000","no":"NG2549"},"000-04J2-0000":{"pid":"000-04J2-0000","no":"NG1896"},"000-04J7-0000":{"pid":"000-04J7-0000","no":"NG1914"}},"example_object":"000-04J2-0000","artists":{"001-00CM-0000":"Gerrit Berckheyde","001-00GJ-0000":"Gerard ter Borch","001-00IC-0000":"Quiringh van Brekelenkam","001-0112-0000":"Dirck van Delen","001-017X-0000":"Carel Fabritius","001-01R2-0000":"Jan van der Heyden","001-01T1-0000":"Pieter de Hooch","001-02J1-0000":"Gabriel Metsu","001-02XG-0000":"Caspar Netscher","001-03K6-0000":"Pieter Saenredam","001-03UQ-0000":"Jan Steen","001-045Q-0000":"Johannes Vermeer","001-04CM-0000":"Emanuel de Witte"},"date_range":{"begin":"1634-01-01","end":"1679-12-31"},"contains":[],"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0002-0000":"Christianity","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0004-0000":"Men","00A-0005-0000":"Women","00A-0007-0000":"Kneeling","00A-000B-0000":"Animals","00A-000C-0000":"Weapons","00A-000D-0000":"Landscapes","00A-000F-0000":"Plants","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000M-0000":"Playing","00A-000N-0000":"Musical instruments","00A-000O-0000":"Music","00A-000P-0000":"Families","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-000S-0000":"Buildings","00A-001A-0000":"Love","00A-001E-0000":"Education","00A-001F-0000":"Books","00A-001H-0000":"Reading","00A-0023-0000":"Children","00A-0028-0000":"Churches","00A-002B-0000":"Furniture","00A-002K-0000":"Dogs","00A-002S-0000":"Swords","00A-0030-0000":"Dutch","00A-0035-0000":"Home","00A-0036-0000":"Housing","00A-003D-0000":"Sculpture","00A-003F-0000":"Weather","00A-003Y-0000":"Thinking","00A-004H-0000":"History","00A-004M-0000":"Houses","00A-004O-0000":"Statues","00A-004P-0000":"Cities","00A-004W-0000":"Leisure","00A-005P-0000":"Inscriptions","00A-005U-0000":"Business","00A-0079-0000":"Tools","00A-007O-0000":"Mirrors"}},"006-0021-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-0021-0000","name":"Room 28","title":"A New Art For A New Nation (1)","description":"<p>The Dutch Republic in the 17th century witnessed one of the most powerfully creative periods in Western art.

He nevertheless continued to receive portrait commissions from some of the most prominent people in the country, who remained impressed with his unparalleled skill in conveying character.<\/p>\n<p>Rembrandt frequently depicted specific models without intending them to be portraits.

Rembrandt\u00e2\u0080\u0099s self-confidence is not only apparent from the fact that he invariably signed his works with his first name (Rembrandt), but also from the sheer number of works in which he painted his own likeness (some 40).

His achievements as an artist, architect, designer, theorist, engineer and scientist are little less than astonishing. Though many of his works were never finished, Leonardo influenced generations of artists. Leonardo trained as a painter and sculptor in the Florentine workshop of Andrea del Verrocchio. There he perfected the exceptional talent for drawing that was key to his artistic and intellectual endeavours.<\/p>\n<p>In 1483 Leonardo moved to Milan, ruled by Duke Ludovico Sforza, hoping to find work as an engineer and scientist. Yet his first Milanese commission was a painting, The Virgin of the Rocks. It was conceived as the central panel of an altarpiece for the chapel of the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception, attached to the church of San Francesco. For reasons that remain unclear, the confraternity rejected Leonardo\u00e2\u0080\u0099s first painting (now in the Mus\u00c3\u00a9e du Louvre, Paris). The National Gallery\u00e2\u0080\u0099s version of The Virgin of the Rocks, begun in the early 1490s, was only completed between 1506 and 1508. Two more paintings from the Immaculate Conception altarpiece, by associates of Leonardo, are displayed in this room.<\/p>\n<p>Leonardo left Milan in 1499, shortly after French troops invaded the city, and returned to Florence. The Burlington House Cartoon dates to this turbulent period. Leonardo is known to have made several life-size works on paper (often called cartoons), but this is the only such drawing to survive. It will have been made in preparation for a painting, but Leonardo probably viewed it as a work of art in itself. Huge crowds flocked to see a similar cartoon by Leonardo, when it was put on public display in Florence in 1501.<\/p>","objects":{"000-02YF-0000":{"pid":"000-02YF-0000","no":"NG6337"},"000-0419-0000":{"pid":"000-0419-0000","no":"NG1093"},"000-041Z-0000":{"pid":"000-041Z-0000","no":"NG1661"},"000-04SP-0000":{"pid":"000-04SP-0000","no":"NG1662"}},"example_object":"000-02YF-0000","artists":{"001-027C-0000":"Leonardo da Vinci","001-03AJ-0000":"Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis"},"date_range":{"begin":"1488-01-01","end":"1508-12-31"},"contains":[],"keywords":{"00A-0001-0000":"Religion","00A-0002-0000":"Christianity","00A-0003-0000":"People","00A-0005-0000":"Women","00A-0006-0000":"Worship","00A-0008-0000":"Robes","00A-000H-0000":"Female","00A-000L-0000":"Clothing","00A-000M-0000":"Playing","00A-000N-0000":"Musical instruments","00A-000O-0000":"Music","00A-000P-0000":"Families","00A-000Q-0000":"Male","00A-0015-0000":"Angels","00A-001D-0000":"Saints","00A-0023-0000":"Children","00A-0024-0000":"Infants","00A-002D-0000":"Boys","00A-0049-0000":"Girls","00A-004T-0000":"Drawings","00A-005P-0000":"Inscriptions"}},"006-0024-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-0024-0000","name":"Room A Wall 08","title":"","description":"","objects":[],"example_object":false,"artists":[],"date_range":[],"contains":[],"keywords":[]},"006-0025-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-0025-0000","name":"Room 65","title":" Southern Germany and Austria","description":"<p>Painters in southern German and Austria collaborated with sculptors to produce spectacular large altarpieces with moveable shutters.

Patrons were increasingly willing to spend money on paintings by British artists, as well as during the Grand Tours they undertook abroad. And portraitists were encouraged to represent their subjects in ambitious and original formats. Portraiture was included in an annual exhibition at the Royal Academy of Arts in London, but it had to hold its own with the narrative painting that was regarded as the artist\u00e2\u0080\u0099s highest calling.<\/p>\n<p>Joshua Reynolds was adept at introducing references to antique sculpture,<br \/>and to the work of the greatest painters of the past, to add dignity and<br \/>authority to his images. Thomas Lawrence was similarly skilled, combining<br \/>precocious painting ability with a directness in characterisation that animates the best of his portraits. Both Lawrence and Johann Zoffany were able to adapt the grandeur and formality of portrait conventions to present their female sitters with particular sympathy.<\/p>","objects":[],"example_object":false,"artists":[],"date_range":[],"contains":[],"keywords":[]},"006-002L-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-002L-0000","name":"Room 54","title":"Milan, Ferrara and Mantua, 1430\u00e2\u0080\u00931530","description":"<p>The court cities of Northern Italy \u00e2\u0080\u0093 including Milan, Ferrara, Mantua and Rimini \u00e2\u0080\u0093 promoted their political status by cultivating their reputations as centres of artistic excellence.<\/p>\n<p>Pisanello, who spent his life moving between several Italian courts, was one of the most celebrated artists of early 15th-century Italy. He was famed as a medallist as well as a painter and draftsman. Paintings like The Vision of Saint Eustace\u00c2\u00a0reflect his courtly patrons\u00e2\u0080\u0099 love of hunting and chivalry and exemplify his ability to record exquisite and naturalistic details.<\/p>\n<p>Later in the century, Vincenzo Foppa worked for the Sforza dukes in Milan. Lorenzo Costa spent most of his life serving the Gonzagas in Mantua but began his career alongside Cosimo Tura and Ercole de\u00e2\u0080\u0099 Roberti, who were employed by the Este in Ferrara. There was much artistic exchange between these courtly centres. Tura and Roberti\u00e2\u0080\u0099s idiosyncratic, quirky paintings suggest a deep engagement with the inventions of Andrea Mantegna, who spent many years in Mantua, and with Early Netherlandish art, which was known and admired in Ferrara.<\/p>\n<p>In the 16th century, they were succeeded by Ferrarese court artist Dosso Dossi, famed for his luminous colouring and dramatic lighting

It soon outgrew its original site, a town-house on Pall Mall. The collection was transferred in 1838 to the purpose-built gallery on Trafalgar Square designed by William Wilkins. Pictures were arranged by the place and period in which they were painted, a practice that has continued to this day. This is illustrated in Giuseppe Gabrielli's painting where visitors are depicted in the Barry rooms, a suite of sumptuously decorated galleries which opened in 1876.<\/p>\n<p>Additions to the building subsequently became necessary: the most recent extensions have been the North Wing galleries in 1975 and the Sainsbury Wing in 1991. By the 1920s the practice of hanging paintings in tiers was abandoned. Paintings of secondary quality were displayed in rooms that were less grand, or put in store, rather than hung high on the walls of the main floor.<\/p>","objects":[],"example_object":false,"artists":[],"date_range":[],"contains":[],"keywords":[]},"006-003K-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-003K-0000","name":"Gallery A: Paintings 1250-1600","title":"","description":"<p>This part of the Gallery A display spans from the Middle Ages to the High Renaissance and includes paintings dating from the 13th to the 16th centuries.

Further groups of portraits, genre scenes and still lifes highlight the very different approach to these subjects in the 19th century, and Emile-Jean-Horace Vernet\u00e2\u0080\u0099s four large battle scenes perfectly illustrate the romantic reinvention of this genre.<\/p>","objects":[],"example_object":false,"artists":[],"date_range":[],"contains":[],"keywords":[]},"006-003M-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-003M-0000","name":"Gallery D","title":"Coming soon: Nicolaes Maes: Dutch Master of the Golden Age","description":"<p>Find out more about our free exhibition, Nicolaes Maes: Dutch Master of the Golden Age, opening 22 February.<\/p>","objects":[],"example_object":false,"artists":[],"date_range":[],"contains":[],"keywords":[]},"006-003N-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-003N-0000","name":"Gallery E","title":"Coming soon: Nicolaes Maes: Dutch Master of the Golden Age","description":"<p>Find out more about our free exhibition, Nicolaes Maes: Dutch Master of the Golden Age, opening 22 February.<\/p>","objects":[],"example_object":false,"artists":[],"date_range":[],"contains":[],"keywords":[]},"006-003O-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-003O-0000","name":"Gallery B Lobby","title":"","description":"","objects":[],"example_object":false,"artists":[],"date_range":[],"contains":[],"keywords":[]},"006-003P-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-003P-0000","name":"Gallery G","title":"Coming soon: Nicolaes Maes: Dutch Master of the Golden Age ","description":"<p>Find out more about our free exhibition, Nicolaes Maes: Dutch Master of the Golden Age, opening 22 February.<\/p>","objects":[],"example_object":false,"artists":[],"date_range":[],"contains":[],"keywords":[]},"006-003Q-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-003Q-0000","name":"The National Gallery","title":"","description":"","objects":[],"example_object":false,"artists":[],"date_range":[],"contains":[],"keywords":[]},"006-003R-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-003R-0000","name":"Wilkins Building","title":"","description":"","objects":[],"example_object":false,"artists":[],"date_range":[],"contains":[],"keywords":[]},"006-003S-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-003S-0000","name":"National Gallery: Level 2","title":"","description":"","objects":[],"example_object":false,"artists":[],"date_range":[],"contains":[],"keywords":[]},"006-003T-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-003T-0000","name":"National Gallery: Level 1","title":"","description":"","objects":[],"example_object":false,"artists":[],"date_range":[],"contains":[],"keywords":[]},"006-003U-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-003U-0000","name":"National Gallery: Level 0","title":"","description":"","objects":[],"example_object":false,"artists":[],"date_range":[],"contains":[],"keywords":[]},"006-003V-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-003V-0000","name":"National Gallery: Level -1","title":"","description":"","objects":[],"example_object":false,"artists":[],"date_range":[],"contains":[],"keywords":[]},"006-003W-0000":{"type":"location","pid":"006-003W-0000","name":"National Gallery: Level -2","title":"","description":"","objects":[],"example_object":false,"artists":[],"date_range":[],"contains":[],"keywords":[]}}
